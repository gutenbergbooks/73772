<span class="fs70">HOW M. DUMAS CAME TO WRITE THESE MEMOIRS.</span></h2>


<p>Of all the remarkably interesting events connected with
the French Revolution, perhaps the one most worthy of
notice is the flight of Louis XVI, and his capture at Varennes.</p>

<p>At the time when I determined to take the trip of which
I will give you some details, and which put me in possession
of the memoirs I am about to publish—that is to say,
about the 19th of June, 1856—I had read almost all that
had been written concerning the above-mentioned flight.</p>

<p>I wish to start from Châlons, because from the fact of
the King being recognized there, came the train of events
which ended at Varennes on the evening of his arrest.</p>

<p>The capture of Louis at Varennes was the culminating
point of royalty. For although it took seven hundred and
four years to arrive at Varennes, it took but nineteen
months to descend from Varennes to the <span lang="fr">Place de la Revolution</span>.</p>

<p>It is not because the heads of three persons, who were
in the carriage that took royalty to the precipice, fell on
the scaffold, that we mark out the event as the greatest in
the French Revolution, and, indeed, in the whole history
of France. No! It is because the arrest of the King in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span>
the little town of Varennes, unknown on the 22nd of June,
and on the morrow fatally immortalized, was the source of
the political convulsions which have since occurred.</p>

<p>My resolution to go to Varennes once taken, I started
from Paris on the 19th of June, 1856, and on the 20th of the
same month, at one o’clock next morning, I arrived at Châlons.</p>

<p>I was, as you know, in search of details actually seen by
eye-witnesses. I soon discovered two old men who could
give me the necessary information. One was a Monsieur
Ricaise, at Châlons—one of the postilions who drove the
King; the other, Monsieur Mathieu, notary, at St. Menehould,
who had seen the horses changed at the moment
that Drouet recognized the King.</p>

<p>But it was especially necessary to discover some one at
Varennes who remembered some incidents connected with
the affair; because at Varennes occurred the most dramatic
part of the whole catastrophe.</p>

<p>I first asked a keeper of the records whether he knew
any one who had seen the King, and assisted to arrest
him?</p>

<p>He mentioned Colonel Réné Besson.</p>

<p>I asked him to give me his address.</p>

<p>“I will do better,” said he,—“I will take you to him.”</p>

<p>At the very moment that we entered by the Rue de
l’Horloge, that place where Louis XVI was arrested, which,
singularly enough, has the shape of the axe of the guillotine,
my guide put his hand on my shoulder.</p>

<p>“Eh!” said he; “here is the very man we want.”</p>

<p>And he showed me, at the corner of the <span lang="fr">Place Latry</span> and
the <span lang="fr">Rue de la Basse</span>, a fine old man, warming himself in
the rays of the sun, and sitting in a large arm-chair before
his door.</p>

<p>It was Colonel Réné Besson.</p>

<p>We drew near to him.</p>

<p>Imagining that we had some business with him, he
arranged himself more comfortably in his chair, and waited
an explanation.</p>

<p>“Ah, ah! is it you, Monsieur Leduc?” said he.</p>

<p>“Yes, Colonel, it is I; and in good company, too, as you
may see,” my companion replied.</p>

<p>“Colonel, I call on you in right of being the son of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span>
one of your old companions in arms; for you took a part
in the Egyptian campaign, under General Desaix?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, I did,” answered he.</p>

<p>“The fact of being the son of an old companion in
arms,” I continued, “and of bearing the name of the conqueror
of Murad Bey, induced me to take the liberty of
calling on you, and asking for information on certain points.
To commence. Were you at the battle of Valmy?”</p>

<p>“I was with my regiment six days before, on the 2nd of
September; and I just missed leaving my bones at La
Force, in trying to rescue a woman—a princess, I should
say.”</p>

<p>“The Princess Lamballe?”</p>

<p>“Exactly so.”</p>

<p>“At this period, I was living then, in the Rue Saint
Honoré with the carpenter, Duplay.”</p>

<p>“You have seen Robespierre, then?”</p>

<p>“Just as I have you. It was I who made the table on
which he wrote the greater part of his speeches.”</p>

<p>“And Danton?”</p>

<p>“Danton? It was he who enrolled me on the 2nd of
September. But I knew Danton, as you say, and Camilles
Desmoulins, Saint Just, and afterwards, later on, the Duke
D’Enghien, and even Marshal Ney.”</p>

<p>“You have seen the Duke D’Enghien?”</p>

<p>“I was secretary to the Minister of War who sentenced
him.”</p>

<p>“And also Marshal Ney?”</p>

<p>“It was he who made me lieutenant-colonel in the
retreat from Moscow.”</p>

<p>“I will never leave you, Colonel; I will be your secretary,
and we will write your memoirs.”</p>

<p>“You are too late,” said he, laughing; “my memoirs are
already three-fourths finished.”</p>

<p>“What? Do you mean to say you have written——”</p>

<p>“Oh, simply to amuse myself: and there is my secretary.
Hush!”</p>

<p>At this moment the door opened, and a beautiful girl of
seventeen or eighteen came towards us.</p>

<p>“Is that your secretary?” I asked.</p>

<p>“Yes; Marie, my dear little granddaughter. Bow to
Monsieur. You ought to, after the sleepless nights you
have passed through thinking of him.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span></p>

<p>“I?” said the girl, blushing. “I do not know the
gentleman!”</p>

<p>“But you know ‘Monte Christo’ and the ‘Three Musketeers?’”</p>

<p>“Monsieur Dumas! Is it possible?” cried she.</p>

<p>“Yes, Monsieur Dumas. You see that you know him.”</p>

<p>“Oh, sir, I am so glad to see you!”</p>

<p>“You will be my accomplice, then, against the Colonel?”</p>

<p>“Against my grandfather?”</p>

<p>“Yes. He has written some memoirs.”</p>

<p>“I know that. It is I who write from his dictation.”</p>

<p>“Ah! they are worth reading.”</p>

<p>“Oh, grandpapa, Monsieur Dumas says that your memoirs
are worth reading!”</p>

<p>“If he wishes to read them, I shall not hinder him,”
said the Colonel.</p>

<p>“Will you really permit me, sir?”</p>

<p>“If I refused you, I should be attaching too much importance
to them.”</p>

<p>“Colonel, I am like the gamin of Paris of Monsieur
Vanderburch—I should like to embrace you.”</p>

<p>“Embrace my secretary; that will give more pleasure to
both of you.”</p>

<p>I looked at Marie and she blushed as red as a cherry.</p>

<p>“Mademoiselle!” I said, imploringly.</p>

<p>She held up her cheeks to me.</p>

<p>I took her hands in mine, and looked at her intently.</p>

<p>“Has Mademoiselle,” I asked the Colonel, “a page in
your memoirs?”</p>

<p>“The last—a white page. But Marie has something to
tell me. What is it, my child?”</p>

<p>“That supper is ready, grandpapa.”</p>

<p>“You hear. Have you an appetite?”</p>

<p>“Unfortunately, I have just dined.”</p>

<p>“I should have liked to clink glasses with you.”</p>

<p>“Will you allow me to breakfast with you to-morrow, instead?
You see, I am taking a liberty with you already.
Mademoiselle can give me the memoirs this evening. I
will read them to-night, and return them to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“What! read them to-night? How many pages are
there, Marie?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span></p>

<p>“Seven or eight hundred, grandfather,” replied the
young girl.</p>

<p>“Seven or eight hundred pages! If you will permit me,
I will copy them.”</p>

<p>Well, the Colonel allowed me to copy from his manuscript
all that had reference to the arrest of the King at
Varennes; and when he died, left me sole possessor of his
memoirs.</p>

<p>Colonel Réné Besson has been gathered to his fathers
three months since, at the good old age of eighty-seven.
He died, on a beautiful sunlit afternoon, when the mellow
tints of autumn were melting into the snowy wreaths of
winter. Peace be with him.</p>

<p>Eight days after his death, I received the manuscript,
with a letter from Marie, who has become one of the most
charming girls I ever met with.</p>

<p>The manuscript I now publish, is that of Colonel Réné
de Besson; and I give it the title that was chosen by him.</p>

<p class="pfs70">(RENE BESSON.)</p>

<hr class="r10">

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_I">CHAPTER I.<br>
<span class="fs70">CONCERNING HIS PARENTAGE AND EARLY YOUTH.</span></h2>


<p>I was born in the village of Islettes, on the banks of a
little river called the Biesme, in the Forest of Argonne,
situated between St. Menehould and Clermont, on the 14th
of July, in the year 1775.</p>

<p>I never had the happiness to experience a mother’s love;
she survived but a few days after my birth. My father,
who was a poor carpenter, out-stayed her loss but five
years.</p>

<p>At five years of age, therefore, I was an orphan, without
a friend in the world.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span></p>

<p>I am wrong and ungrateful to say that. I had one—my
uncle, my mother’s brother, who had the post of keeper in
the Forest of Argonne. His wife, on my mother’s death,
supplied her place; and he, on the death of my father,
found me bread.</p>

<p>My father died so poor, that all had to be sold to pay his
little debts, with the exception of his box of carpenter’s
tools, which had been taken to Father Descharmes (that
was my uncle’s name), and placed out of sight in a little
room belonging to me.</p>

<p>The Forest of Argonne was Government property, and
was preserved for the pleasure of the nobles attendant on
the Court; but that did not hinder the young people of the
environs from coming secretly with the keepers, to enjoy a
little sport with the deer and the hares.</p>

<p>There was one, who took part in these hunting parties,
whom I knew well—Jean Baptiste Drouet, son of a postmaster
at St. Menehould; also William, a friend of his;
and one Billaut, who afterwards took the name of his native
place, and called himself Billaut Varennes.</p>

<p>All three were to acquire a certain celebrity in the middle
of those revolutionary movements, still hidden in the
future.</p>

<p>Certain young noblemen, by very special favor received
privileges of game denied to the outer world.</p>

<p>Amongst the number of those young nobles, was M. de
Dampierre, the Count de Mannes, and the Viscount de
Malmy.</p>

<p>The former was at this time a man of about forty-five
years, the latter not over twenty.</p>

<p>I select these out of the number, because they will play
leading parts in the events I am about to describe.</p>

<p>Even when I was quite a child, I learned the difference
that subsisted in their characters.</p>

<p>Every now and then, on hearing that a herd of wild
boars had been seen in the forest, or that the snowstorm
had driven out the wolves, a courier would arrive from
Paris, and announce “The gentlemen of the Court.”</p>

<p>Then it was that the fun took place.</p>

<p>If it were summer, a tent was pitched, in which the gentlemen
took their meals.</p>

<p>If it were winter, they stopped at St. Menehould, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span>
put up at the “<span lang="fr">Hotel de Metz</span>,” making a rendezvous with
the keepers at daybreak at a likely spot for wild boars or
wolves. When there, the dogs were unleashed, and the
sport commenced.</p>

<p>When they went, away, they would leave twenty or
twenty-five louis to be divided among the keepers.</p>

<p>In general, these nobles of the Court were exceedingly
polite towards the underlings. Twice the Prince de Condé
and his son, the Duke D’Enghien came.</p>

<p>On such occasions, being, as it were, high holiday, I
would follow the sportsmen. Once when the Duke D’Enghien
lost his way, I put him right, and he offered me a
louis. I refused it. (I was only nine years old.)</p>

<p>He looked at me with astonishment, and asked my name.</p>

<p>“Réné Besson. I am the nephew of Father Descharmes,”
I replied.</p>

<p>“Good, my boy,” said he; “I won’t forget thee!”</p>

<p>Two years afterwards the Prince came back. I was then
eleven, and thought that he must have lost all remembrance
of me.</p>

<p>But he had not; and he came to me.</p>

<p>“Ah, art thou not Réné Besson?” he said. “Nephew
of Father Descharmes?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Prince.”</p>

<p>“Then here is something for thee,” said he, giving me a
gun. “And this is for thy uncle,” he continued, handing
me a folded paper.</p>

<p>This paper contained the appointment of my uncle to the
vacant post of chief huntsman.</p>

<p>As for the gun, it was a beautiful weapon, and I have
carefully kept it through my career, in memory of the
unfortunate Prince who gave it.</p>

<p>In the meantime I was growing up. I had learned to
read and write indifferently well; and whilst my uncle was
busy in his vocation, I used to occupy myself with carpentry,
a calling for which I evinced much aptitude and taste.</p>

<p>I was now twelve years of age. I knew every inch of
the Forest of Argonne, and I was as good a shot as any of
the keepers, and my sole ambition was to take my uncle’s
place when he resigned, which he intended to do in four or
five years.</p>

<p>There was a place, however, left vacant by the resignation<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span>
of a keeper, which I thought would just suit me for
the time; and I determined to solicit the patronage of the
Duke D’Enghien.</p>

<p>Time passed on, and we arrived at the opening of the
year 1788.</p>

<p>For five years we had not seen M. Drouet, for, after a
quarrel with his father, he had enlisted in the Queen’s
Dragoons.</p>

<p>One fine morning, however, we heard from his friend
William that Father Drouet had become reconciled to him,
and had resigned to him his situation of postmaster.</p>

<p>One day, we saw a dragoon stop in front of our house,
get off his horse, fasten his bridle to a ring, and then come
tramping up to the door.</p>

<p>“Well, Father Descharmes,” said the soldier, “haven’t
you a glass of wine in the house for an old friend?”</p>

<p>My uncle looked at him amazed.</p>

<p>“Ah!” said I; “don’t you recognize him, uncle? It is
Monsieur Jean Baptiste.”</p>

<p>“Well, I never—so it is!” cried my uncle, coming forward
with outstretched hands.</p>

<p>But, stopping for a moment, he added, “I beg your pardon,
Monsieur Drouet.”</p>

<p>“Pardon for what?—for remembering a friend? The
fault would have been to forget him. Come, shake hands.
Are not all Frenchmen brothers?”</p>

<p>“They are; but, at the same time, there are great and
small.”</p>

<p>“Good! but, in two or three years, I will say to you,
‘There are neither great nor small. All are children of one
mother, and all will have their rights before man, as before
heaven.’”</p>

<p>“Ha! Is that the sort of schooling they give you in
the Queen’s Dragoons, Monsieur Jean Baptiste?”</p>

<p>“Not only in the Queen’s Dragoons, but in all other
regiments, old Nimrod.”</p>

<p>My uncle took three glasses from the cupboard, filled
two, and half-filled the other for me.</p>

<p>Drouet took up his glass.</p>

<p>“To the nation!” said he.</p>

<p>“What is that word?” inquired my uncle.</p>

<p>“It is a new one, which I hope will yet gain the rights<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span>
of the middle classes. That youngster there; what are
you going to do with him?”</p>

<p>“Make him my successor.”</p>

<p>Drouet shook his head.</p>

<p>“My good old Descharmes!” said he, “you belong to
the past. Better far an independent and honorable position
for a man, than to wear a livery which, no matter how
gay it is, puts you at the mercy of the first whippersnapper
that comes. I thought Réné was a carpenter?”</p>

<p>“So I am, Monsieur Jean Baptiste; but I only play at
joiner work.”</p>

<p>“Nay, look you here!” said my uncle, proud to be able
to show some of my handiwork. “Here is a wardrobe the
youngster has made.”</p>

<p>Drouet went forward, and examined the construction in
question with more interest than it deserved.</p>

<p>“Good—very good!” he said. “Go on as you are
doing, my boy; and, believe me, it is far better to work for
the public, than to be a game-keeper dependent on a
prince, liable to be turned away should a wild boar make
an unforeseen bolt, or a wolf force the line of beaters.”</p>

<p>“But,” answered I, “you must know that I have a gun,
Monsieur Jean Baptiste; and a gun, too, given me by the
Duke D’Enghien.”</p>

<p>And saying this, I showed him the cherished weapon,
with as much pride as my uncle had displayed in exhibiting
my efforts at wardrobe making.</p>

<p>“A pretty gun,” he said, looking at it attentively;
“and I see that it bears the royal mark. If you take my
advice, you will not hesitate between the plane which your
father left you, and a gun which a prince gave you. The
carpenter’s plane is the bread-winner that the philosopher
of Geneva put into the hands of his favorite pupil; and
ever since the day that ‘Emile’ appeared, the plane has
been ennobled.”</p>

<p>“What is ‘Emile,’ Monsieur Jean Baptiste?” I asked.</p>

<p>“It is the work of one who teaches that all men are
citizens together, and that all citizens are brothers. Keep
your gun, Réné, to preserve your country; but also keep
your plane to preserve your independence. Be a carpenter
to the people at large, my boy; but be no one’s servant,
not even if he be a prince. The first opportunity I have,
I will send you ‘Emile’ to read.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span></p>

<p>So saying, and squeezing the hand of his old friend,
M. Jean Baptiste remounted his horse. As I held his
stirrup he lifted me gently to his saddle bow, and placed
his hand on my head.</p>

<p>“Réné Besson,” he said, with dignity, “in the name of
that grand future of liberty, with which France is even
now in travail, I baptize thee citizen.”</p>

<p>Then relinquishing me, and striking his spurs into his
horse, he disappeared down the forest.</p>

<p>Next day a messenger came from M. Jean Baptiste
Drouet, who, faithful to his promise of the night before,
sent me a little book, with these words written on the first
page—</p>

<p class="center">
“To the Citizen Réné Besson, carpenter.”<br>
</p>

<p>The little book in question was “Emile.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II.<br>
<span class="fs70">THE FIRST SEEDS OF A POLITICAL FAITH.</span></h2>


<p>When I came to examine the book which M. Jean Baptiste
had sent me, and the title of which was “Emile, or
Education,” I sought out the chapter which had direct
reference to my own case.</p>

<p>In the course of my search I came across the following
paragraph:—</p>

<p>“It is my positive desire that Emilie should learn a
trade. An honest one, at least, you will perhaps say.
What means that? Every calling useful to the public is
an honest one, is it not? I don’t wish particularly that he
should be a carver and gilder, neither do I particularly care
that he should be an actor, or a musician. Still, let him
adopt any one of those professions, or others resembling
them, that he may fancy. I do not wish to fetter his will
in anything, only I would rather he was a shoemaker than
a poet, and would much prefer him to earn his livelihood by
paving-stones than by porcelain.”</p>

<p>I read over and over again, the paragraph which opened
up this train of thought; and at last, I understood it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span></p>

<p>Let no one be astonished that my intelligence was so
slow. Taken up as I was until I had reached at this time,
my fourteenth year, with the usual jog-trot of rustic occupations,
my mind had remained in a sort of twilight.</p>

<p>I continued my reading.</p>

<p>“The needle and the sword can never be wielded by the
same hand. If I were a king, I would only permit the ell,
the wand, and the shears, to women, and to maimed men,
equally feeble with the weaker sex. I would forbid callings
against health, but not those which are simply laborious, or
even dangerous, for those demand at once both strength
and courage. Everything considered, the trade which I
should like a pupil of mine to adopt of himself would be
that of a carpenter.”</p>

<p>“Ah,” said I, “what a good fellow this Monsieur Rosseau
is! How I do like him!”</p>

<p>I tackled to my book again.</p>

<p>“Touching a carpenter’s trade, it is a tidy calling: it is
useful; you can follow it in the house; it requires both
skill and industry; whilst the exercise of taste is not excluded
from the articles it turns out.”</p>

<p>So, then, I was precisely in the state recommended by
the author of “Emile.”</p>

<p>Not only that, but I did not even require to learn the
trade he praised; I knew it already. I read on as
follows:—</p>

<p>“Of all states and conditions of life, the most independent
is that of a mechanic. A mechanic is dependent upon
his work only; he is just so much free as an agricultural
laborer is a slave; for the latter can only prepare the field,
and leave the product thereof to fate. A foe—a powerful
neighbor—a law-suit, can deprive him of his field; in fact,
that very field can be made to vex him in a thousand different
ways. But, if fate disturbs a mechanic, he gathers
his tools together, and, carrying his sturdy arms with him,
away he goes.”</p>

<p>At this point, I looked at my own arms, already muscular
and well-developed, and I swung them in the air with pride.
Evidently the man was right who wrote those lines.</p>

<p>I uttered a cry of joy; and rushing into my little workshop,
I hugged severally to my bosom my hammers, my
planes, and my chisels. Then, strong with a new strength,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span>
I felt irresistibly impelled to rush off at once, and thank
M. Jean Baptiste Drouet for lending me the precious book.
St. Menehould was exactly three miles away, and it was
only eleven o’clock in the morning. I could easily be home
again by five or six, and my good uncle would not make
himself uneasy at my absence. Besides, I was quite sure
that he would approve of my errand.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III.<br>
<span class="fs70">A STRANGER OF INFLUENCE TURNS UP.</span></h2>


<p>Out I set at once, taking my book with me, to read on
the way; and so interesting did I find the adventures of
“Emile,” that I found myself near my friend’s house
actually without being aware of it.</p>

<p>In the distance I could see M. Jean Baptiste superintending
some postilions, who were putting fresh horses to a
carriage. He was standing on the threshold of his door.</p>

<p>Running up in a state of great excitement, I cried out,
“Monsieur Jean Baptiste, it’s I!”</p>

<p>“Well,” he said, laughing; “I am quite aware of the
fact. What do you want, my boy?”</p>

<p>“What do I want? Oh, I want to thank you, and to
tell you that I will never be a keeper. The only calling
worth following is that of a carpenter, and I mean to be
one, Monsieur Drouet.”</p>

<p>The carriage went off.</p>

<p>“So you have been reading ‘Emile?’” he asked, taking
me inside.</p>

<p>“Yes; up to here.” And I showed him page 160 of the
work.</p>

<p>“Bravo!” said Monsieur Drouet. “But it is not
enough to read; you must also understand.”</p>

<p>“Of course, M. Jean Baptiste,” said I. “There are
many things that I cannot understand, but I always look
to you for an explanation.”</p>

<p>“So you are come expressly for that?”</p>

<p>“No, M. Jean Baptiste. Not expressly for that, but to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span>
thank you for your kindness. After my father, who gave
me life—after my aunt and my uncle, who have fed me, I
owe more to you than to any other person in the world;
for has not Rousseau himself said that every man is born
twice—first, physically, then intellectually? And it is you
who have successfully brought me through this second
birth.”</p>

<p>I must pass over that afternoon of familiar intercourse
with my mentor and my friend. Suffice it to say, that my
new-born resolutions were strengthened, my eyes still more
widely opened to my own wants and requirements; and
when I set out on my return, I felt that, indeed, a path had
been tracked for me across the yet untrodden wilderness of
life.</p>

<p>There are few landscapes so pretty in the middle of
France as that which presents itself to the eye on arriving
at the Forest of Argonne.</p>

<p>This struck me as it had never done before, and I paused
involuntarily to gaze at the scene.</p>

<p>At this moment two travellers came towards me, followed
by a carriage slowly toiling up the ascent.</p>

<p>One of these strangers particularly attracted my attention.
He might be about fifty years of age, of no great
stature, but wiry and strongly built. He had a noble head,
and his weather-beaten face was lit by the glance of an
eagle. Had not the scar of a sabre wound sufficiently indicated
his profession, I could have told he was a soldier
from the unmistakable way in which he wore his civilian’s
suit.</p>

<p>His companion, younger and stouter, was likewise a soldier;
but evidently not of the same standing.</p>

<p>These two men halted a moment near me, less to look at
the landscape than to continue an animated conversation,
in which the elder sustained the principal part.</p>

<p>“Yes, my dear Thévenot,” he said; “I will never give
in on this point. If ever France is invaded by Montmedy
and Verdun, it is here that we must meet the enemy; with
20,000 soldiers I’ll engage to stop a foe 80,000 strong. The
Forest of Argonne is the Thermopylæ of France.”</p>

<p>“That is to say. General,” replied the other, who looked
like his aide-de-camp, “if the two or three roads through
the forest could be defended as easily as this one; for it is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span>
quite evident that a couple of batteries with six guns each
would make this defile impracticable.”</p>

<p>“There are only two roads,” returned the General; “the
one we are now pursuing, leading to Islettes; and the
other, the Grand Prés road. Both these routes conjoin at
Verdun.”</p>

<p>“I thought there was a third—namely, the Chéne-Populeux
road.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think that road leads through the forest at all;
but I will ask our driver.”</p>

<p>The General did so.</p>

<p>The bumpkin only shook his head.</p>

<p>“I only know,” he said, “the road I’m accustomed to
travel, and that’s not it. Beyond that, I can’t tell you
anything; but,” he added, nodding towards me, “if you
want to know all about this part of the country, why,
there’s the nephew of Father Descharmes, who knows it all
blindfold. Hilloa, boy! come and speak to these gentlemen!”</p>

<p>I approached, cap in hand, for the look of the elder
traveller inspired me with respect.</p>

<p>“Friend,” said the General, seeing that I waited till he
spoke to me; “we want to know where the Chéne-Populeux
road leads from, and if it takes you through the forest, or
round by the outskirts?”</p>

<p>“It leads from Stenay, monsieur, takes round by the
forest, and opens upon Voneg, at the River Aisne.”</p>

<p>“Ah, now we have it, Thévenot; but as, so far as I can
remember, the Chéne-Populeux road is only a narrow defile,
I still hold my original opinion.”</p>

<p>“Will you get in now, gentlemen?” asked the postilion.
“My horses are well breathed by this time.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, my young friend,” said the General, waving
his hand towards me. But just as he had his foot on the
step the distant sound of an alarm-bell, violently rung,
came through the stillness.</p>

<p>“What is that?” cried the General.</p>

<p>“A fire at the village of Islettes,” said I. “Look! you
can see the smoke above the trees!”</p>

<p>And, without any further speculation, off I ran towards
the village. The General called after me, but I did not
stop to listen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[37]</span></p>

<p>However, before I had gone a hundred yards, the carriage
rattled past me at a gallop. The General, evidently moved
by a humane motive, was hastening, like myself, towards
the scene of the catastrophe, where I soon arrived.</p>

<p>All the village was astir, and I found the General and
his companion had taken command of the rustics, just as
they would of an army on the field of battle.</p>

<p>The fire had broken out in the workshop of a cart-wright.
The fiery element had attacked an adjacent shed full of
wood, and threatened to reduce the neighboring house to
ashes.</p>

<p>Now, at Islettes, fire-engines were unknown, and I need
scarcely say that handing along little buckets of water
from the river was by no means an effectual remedy.</p>

<p>“We must cut off the fire!” shouted the General.</p>

<p>“But how?” returned the peasants.</p>

<p>“I want somebody,” cried the General, “who will get
up upon the roof of that shed, and cut away the principal
support. The post will fall, and carry the roof with it.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes!” said a voice; “and the somebody in question
will go down with the roof!”</p>

<p>“Very likely!” acquiesced the General, calmly; “but
the fire will be smothered, and the rest of the village
saved.”</p>

<p>At that moment, a certain passage from “Emile” flashed
across my mind.</p>

<p>“Give me an axe!” I cried. As I spoke, I saw one
leaning against a house near which I was standing.</p>

<p>I laid down my “Emile” and a dictionary which M.
Jean Baptiste had given me; seized the axe, and rushed
into the house adjacent to the shed. Already its inmates
were carrying out all their little property, expecting every
instant that their cottage would be in flames.</p>

<p>Up the little wooden stairs I rushed, and scrambled out
on the roof through a sort of trap-door.</p>

<p>It was my first experience upon roofs; but as I had been
accustomed to climbing trees up to any height, a promenade
on the thatch was only child’s play.</p>

<p>Below, all was hushed in anxiety. I could only hear the
peculiar billow-like sounds of the flames, and the fall of the
burning fragments as they gave way under the fire.</p>

<p>Presently I found myself in a dense atmosphere of smoke<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[38]</span>
and sparks. I was nearly stifled; but I knew that all eyes
and hearts were fixed upon me, and that gave me strength
to succeed or to die, as it might be.</p>

<p>Supporting myself by the chimney, I commenced to cut
away a hole round about the roof-tree.</p>

<p>I was strong of my age, and could wield with dexterity
the axe—that instrument of my adopted calling; but
though at every blow the upright beam trembled—on the
other hand, the advancing flame seemed to increase in volume.</p>

<p>There was, in a word, a battle between me and the flame,
and I felt proud to have an element for my foe. All at
once, the gable-end fell in with a terrible crash; the other
supports of the roof being weakened by my blows, gave
way, and the roof itself fell, smothering, beneath the raging
flames. I flung the axe away from me, and held on
like grim death to my chimney. A whirlwind of smoke
and fire blotted me from the crowd below, and, half suffocated
as I was, I could still hear and understand their
murmur of pain and anxiety.</p>

<p>The crisis was over. With one last effort I struggled to
my trap-door, and in another moment—I know not how—found
myself safe and sound in the open air.</p>

<p>Friendly arms embraced me, and looking up, I saw it
was the General, who held in one hand my precious books.
“My boy,” he said, “you are brave, and you read Rousseau:
therefore I do not offer you a reward. But you will
be a true man, and I embrace you.”</p>

<p>And again he pressed me in his arms.</p>

<p>By this time, my uncle, and, indeed, all the village, were
at my side; and whilst I was receiving their congratulations,
the General and his friend had departed. No one
knew who they were.</p>

<p>This was an important day in my life; for I had learnt
to understand what was conveyed in that most beautiful of
all human words—self-devotion.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV.<br>
<span class="fs70">I EDUCATE MYSELF FOR CONTINGENCIES.</span></h2>


<p>Next day I laid up for myself a course of study—physical
and intellectual. In the morning I read and studied
my books; during the day I worked at my carpentry;
towards evening I indulged in shooting, in gymnastics, and
sports of that nature; and at night I again returned to my
books. I improved every day.</p>

<p>About a week after the events of the last chapter,
M. Drouet, and two friends came to my uncle’s.</p>

<p>M. Drouet and his friends shook me by the hand. He
asked me how I was getting on, and I told him all, regretting
at the same time that I had no money to buy books,
or get instruction in Latin.</p>

<p>“No money!” said Jean Baptiste. “Who hinders you
from making it?”</p>

<p>“Making it?” I answered. “But how?”</p>

<p>“With your plane, of course.”</p>

<p>“But, Monsieur Drouet, I have no customers.”</p>

<p>“I will find them for you.”</p>

<p>“Where?”</p>

<p>“To begin with, the postmaster of St. Menehould, Jean
Baptiste Drouet by name. The fact is, I require a quantity
of carpentry work done in my house, and you must undertake
it.”</p>

<p>“I am not good enough workman for that, Monsieur
Drouet.”</p>

<p>“But if I find you good enough?”</p>

<p>“Then I would not like to take your money.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense! I must get somebody to do it, so that is
settled. Now, about the Latin. I will find you a teacher—Monsieur
Fortin, the Curé of Islettes.”</p>

<p>“How will I pay him?”</p>

<p>“I don’t think that he would take your money.”</p>

<p>“But I take yours, Monsieur Drouet.”</p>

<p>“Ah, that is different. Government does not pay me to
make wash-hand-stands, but it does pay Abbé Fortin to instruct
his flock morally and intellectually.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span></p>

<p>“I should like to offer him something.”</p>

<p>“Exactly—not as a right, but as a graceful act of
courtesy; and as I know the Father Fortin does not
despise the good things of this life, you can shoot him a
hare occasionally, or knock him up a cupboard, to keep his
preserves in.”</p>

<p>“A thousand thanks, Monsieur Jean!”</p>

<p>“Listen! I have it in my mind’s eye that you will be
a soldier—at all events, the education necessary for an
officer will not be thrown away. For six francs a month,
Bertrand, of Islettes, the old soldier, will teach you fencing;
and, for a trifle more, Mathieu, the land surveyor, at
Clermont, will show you how to draw a plan. As for
horsemanship, I will give you the run of my stable; so,
there you are, with your life-time all mapped out. Now,
let us to the forest.”</p>

<p>At dinner that day, the conversation turned upon politics,
and particularly on the unpopularity of Marie Antoinette,
the Queen. All this was Greek to me, till M. Jean
Baptiste explained the situation of affairs.</p>

<p>Marie Antoinette, it appeared, daughter of the Austrian,
Marie Therèse, and ancient enemy of France, had been
accepted by the French people as a harbinger of union and
of peace. Very different, however, had been her influence.</p>

<p>In a word, Marie Therèse hoped that Louis XVI would
some day aid her to get back the provinces wrested from
her by Prussia.</p>

<p>Until 1778, Marie Antoinette did not meddle with affairs
of state. Up to that time, Turgot was the ruling spirit;
but, at last, he had to succumb to that famous De Calone,
who used to reply thus to the demands of the Queen:
“Madame, if it is possible, it is already done; if it is impossible,
it will be done.”</p>

<p>Misrule went on. The King, despite his impoverished
treasury, bought St. Cloud; the Queen, whilst her people
were starving, purchased Rambouillet, and lavished millions
of francs which were not her own upon her immediate favorites.
Scandal arose; and when scandal gets into everybody’s
mouth, it is worse than truth.</p>

<p>M. de Calone resigned. He could not make both ends
meet.</p>

<p>The next Prime Minister was Brienne, a Queen’s favorite;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span>
and, when he fell, Paris was illuminated from the Bastille
to the <span lang="fr">Cour de la Reine</span>.</p>

<p>M. de Necker reigned in his stead. He was a Genevese
banker, and a financier of the first force; but even he failed
to see a way out of the royal bankruptcy; and it was whispered
that he was going to ask the nation what it thought
of matters—France was to speak.</p>

<p>This was the great news at my uncle’s dinner-table that
day, and our three guests were very merry over it, and
pledged fidelity to each other however these events might
turn out.</p>

<p>And they kept their word.</p>

<span class="fs70">I BREAK WITH THE ARISTOCRACY.</span></h2>


<p>Next morning I set out for St. Menehould, to see about
M. Drouet’s job. He told me what he wanted, and that he
should require the new furniture I was to make him to be
of good, well-seasoned oak. In order that I might set
about it the more easily, he paid me one hundred francs in
advance; and with this prodigious sum in my pocket, I
went off to select the necessary timber, when whom should
I meet but Bertrand. The old soldier informed me that
M. Drouet had spoken to him about giving me fencing lessons,
and I arranged with him, on the spot, when I was to
take them. In fact, I began that very day.</p>

<p>I remember well how my hand trembled with pleasure,
when I grasped the foil for the first time. At the end of
an hour, I knew the five parades, and could disengage
decently.</p>

<p>“That will do for to-day,” cried my master, more tired
than I was myself.</p>

<p>I recollected something.</p>

<p>“Monsieur Bertrand,” said I; “I shall perhaps not be
able to pay you till the end of the month.”</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s all settled. Monsieur Drouet has paid me a
month in advance. He said that he owed you money.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span></p>

<p>I felt a glow of emotion at this new proof of my good
friend’s generosity.</p>

<p>As I was crossing a field on my way home, I met the
surveyor, M. Mathieu. My good genius had preceded me
there, too: the surveyor was quite ready to impart to me
the mysteries of the chain and level.</p>

<p>Leaving him, I went home in great glee, took my gun,
and sallied forth to slaughter partridges for my Latin master.
I was fortunate enough to knock over a brace of birds
and a hare, which I sent the same night to the Abbé
Fortin.</p>

<p>Next day, as I was planing away with great zeal, the
Abbé himself stood before me.</p>

<p>“Well, my boy, you have sent me some game, and you
must now help me to eat it. Dinner at two, and I shall be
glad to see your uncle, if he will come with you.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Monsieur l’Abbé, it is too much honor!”</p>

<p>“At two o’clock, mind. Marguerite, the housekeeper,
does not like to be kept waiting.”</p>

<p>So saying, the worthy Curé left me.</p>

<p>My uncle, I found, would not be at home till the evening,
so, at the hour appointed, I found myself alone, tapping at
the Abbé’s door, and dressed out in all my Sunday splendor.</p>

<p>The Curé opened it himself.</p>

<p>“Ah, monsieur, I am so sorry to trouble you!”</p>

<p>“Trouble? Nonsense! Only Marguerite cannot be at
the door and at her kitchen stove at the same time. Talking
of which, she tells me we will not have dinner till
three. Now, what do you say to a first Latin lesson, as my
friend Drouet tells me that you wish to learn that language.”</p>

<p>I was only too glad to acquiesce; and, before dinner was
served, I understood that there were five declensions in the
Roman tongue.</p>

<p>During the simple repast which followed, I surveyed the
Abbé’s furniture with a critical eye, and a mental resolve
to do it all up for him again.</p>

<p>Then, after having arranged about my future hours with
my kind preceptor, I returned home, one step further up
the ladder of progress. That very evening, we were
apprised of a visit of the Count de Dampierre, the Viscount
de Malmy, and some other young nobles.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span></p>

<p>Hitherto, I had been in the habit of accompanying them,
dressed in regular keeper’s costume; but now I stuck
steadily to my carpentry work.</p>

<p>“Holloa, Réné!” said M. de Dampierre; “don’t you go
with us to-day?”</p>

<p>“No, Monsieur le Comte,” I replied; “I have a lesson
in mathematics to-day.”</p>

<p>“What?” he exclaimed, with surprise. “Do you study
mathematics?”</p>

<p>“Yes, and history and Latin, also.”</p>

<p>“And is all this necessary in our days for a game-keeper?”</p>

<p>“I am not going to be one.”</p>

<p>“What then?”</p>

<p>“I mean to be a carpenter, like ‘Emile.’”</p>

<p>“I don’t know him.”</p>

<p>“No? It is the ‘Emile’ of Monsieur Jean Jacques
Rousseau that I mean; but if the nation wants me, I shall
be a soldier.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean by nation?”</p>

<p>“I mean our country—France.”</p>

<p>“We call that the kingdom, do we not?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Monsieur le Comte; but some think it high time
that we should call it a nation.”</p>

<p>“Then the mathematics are to teach you military engineering?”</p>

<p>“Yes; every officer should know how to draw a plan.”</p>

<p>“Officer! But before you can be an officer, you must be
an aristocrat.”</p>

<p>“At present, yes; but by the time I am ready, there
may be changes in the system.”</p>

<p>“You heard that, Malmy,” said M. de Dampierre, turning
to the Viscount.</p>

<p>“Yes!” replied the other, shrugging his shoulders.</p>

<p>“And what do you think of it all?” asked M. de Dampierre.</p>

<p>“I think that the class to which he belongs are losing
their heads altogether.”</p>

<p>I planed away vigorously, and affected not to hear. By-and-bye
they strolled off to the forest, laughing, whilst I
got ready to go to M. Mathieu, for my first lesson in
engineering.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI.<br>
<span class="fs70">THE NATION AND THE BASTILLE.—VERDICT FOR THE
FORMER.</span></h2>


<p>At the end of the fifteenth day the Abbé Fortin had his
furniture retouched, and when three months had expired I
had finished the carpentry work for M. Drouet.</p>

<p>The work was estimated at five hundred francs, the
materials alone costing a hundred and twenty; so that I
received three hundred and eighty, with the compliments
of my two masters on the excellency of my workmanship.</p>

<p>Whilst I was still engaged on the completion of the
order, M. Drouet advanced me five hundred francs, to
enable me to buy the wood, and at the same time, to take
my lessons in the use of implements of warfare, and purchase
useful books.</p>

<p>The warrant expected from M. Necker, for the convocation
of the Etats Généraux, had appeared. For the first
time, a great nation, or a great kingdom, as M. Dampierre
said, admitted all its members to political rights.</p>

<p>No sooner had the warrant appeared (which can be
translated in these words:—“All will assemble to elect;
all will write their grievances in the books given to them
for that purpose”) than all France thrilled, as it were, with
an electric shock, and the people leapt from darkness into
light.</p>

<p>That cry, treasured up for two centuries, becomes
stronger and stronger every day. They complain that the
year 1788 was barren; that the winter was bitterly cold;
that the famine in the following spring was terrible.</p>

<p>They went to the municipality of St. Menehould, to
write in the books; and my capital penmanship procured
me the office of secretary.</p>

<p>Afterwards, they went to election. MM. Drouet, Guillaume,
and Billaud exercised enormous influence.</p>

<p>M. Dampierre was balloted with a poor parish priest.
The priest prevailed over him.</p>

<p>The event deceived all. The Etats, which ought to have
opened on the 27th of April, were adjourned to the 4th of
May.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span></p>

<p>The Court was frightened, and delayed the matter as
long as it could.</p>

<p>All France had its eyes turned to Paris. Every hour
brought forth unexpected events.</p>

<p>On the 5th of May, the opening of the Etats, in the
procession from Versailles, the King was applauded, and
the Queen hissed.</p>

<p>On the 8th of May, the three classes were changed into
two—the one formed of the third class, the other of the
nobility and clergy.</p>

<p>On the 18th of June, the assembly hall was closed by
order of the King.</p>

<p>On the 22nd of June, the oath of Jeu-de-Pauvre was
taken.</p>

<p>This oath was the declaration of war from the third Etat
against the nobility and clergy. It was the first menace
direct from the people against the throne.</p>

<p>All in a moment, these comparatively small events ceased,
and a portentous calm intervened, so to speak, as if the
minor combatants held their weapons to intently watch the
issue of the combat between their superiors.</p>

<p>On the 12th of July, M. Drouet started for Paris.</p>

<p>It was the day of the dismissal of Necker—it was the
day when Camille Desmoulins, jumping on a table in a <i lang="fr">café</i>,
drew his sword, and crying, “To arms!” placed the leaf
of a tree in his hat.</p>

<p>We had no news of M. Drouet up to the 15th.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 15th, MM. Dampierre and De
Valmy went out hunting, to which sport were invited two
or three of their friends from Clermont and Varennes;
among others, a certain Chevalier de Courtemont, whom we
shall come across later on.</p>

<p>It was evident that the hunt was but a secondary affair,
and that the real object was to meet and hear the news
from Paris.</p>

<p>M. Dampierre had heard, on the 13th, that Paris was on
fire, and the Court at Versailles guarded by German troops,—Benzenval
commanding, under the old Marshal de Broglie.</p>

<p>The theatres were shut. The dismissal of Necker had,
to a certain extent, paralyzed the public mind. Statues of
him and of the Duke of Orleans were covered with crape,
and paraded through the streets of Paris.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span></p>

<p>The procession, armed with sticks, swords, and pistols,
after having passed through the streets Saint Martin and
Saint Honoré, arrived at the Place Vendome.</p>

<p>There one division stopped, and having dispersed the
people, destroyed the bust of the Prince and the Duke of
Orleans, and put to death a French guard who disdained to
fly.</p>

<p>That was not all.</p>

<p>M. de Bezenval had put a detachment of Swiss and four
pieces of cannon in battery on the Champs Elysées, the
crowd retired to the Tuileries, and the Prince de Lambese,
a German, charged upon them with his cavalry, inoffensive
though they were, and was the first to enter, on horseback,
the gardens of the Tuileries. A barricade stopped him.
From the back of that barricade, stones and bottles were
thrown at him. He perceived that a group of men were
shutting the gate, to take him prisoner. He ordered a
retreat, and, in flying, crushed one man under his steed,
and severely wounded another with a blow from his sabre.</p>

<p>The crowd now entered the armorers’ shops, and ransacked
them.</p>

<p>The cannons were mounted on the Bastille, which was
reinforced by another detachment of Swiss.</p>

<p>They knew nothing more on the night of the 13th, nor
on the next day.</p>

<p>M. Dampierre ordered that if news came in the day, it
was to be delivered to my uncle.</p>

<p>At four o’clock the sport finished, and they returned to
the house. A dinner, prepared as usual, awaited them.</p>

<p>The companions remained at table, visibly preoccupied;
the conversation was nothing but conjectures. They spoke
in strong terms of the National Assembly. They wished
to have been in the place of M. Brézé, of M. de Bezenval,
of M. de Lambese; they were sure that they could have
done better than they did.</p>

<p>The Queen was too good, not to have commanded the
Swiss to exterminate the wretches.</p>

<p>At six o’clock, M. Dampierre’s servant brought a despatch.
It was dated the morning of the 14th.</p>

<p>On the night of the 13th the people had forced the doors
of the Invalides, and had taken thirty thousand muskets.
They had also forced the doors of the Arsenal with sledge-hammers,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span>
and had taken seven or eight tons of powder.
That powder had been distributed under the lamp-lights.
Each man bearing a musket received fifty cartridges.</p>

<p>The Court had ordered all the foreign regiments, useful
to royalty, to be at hand, if wanted.</p>

<p>M. de Launay, the Governor of the Bastille, who knew
his unpopularity, and upon whom they could count, because
of that unpopularity, had pledged himself to blow the Bastille
into the air, along with half Paris, before he would
surrender.</p>

<p>This news the companions thought good, as it promised
a desperate resistance.</p>

<p>On the other hand, who were the people who menaced
royalty? Men ignorant of the use of fire-arms, undisciplined,
and without leaders, who would retreat at the first
cannon-shot, and fly at the first charge.</p>

<p>How could that rabble hold out against practised soldiers,
who feared not death, but disgrace?</p>

<p>On mastering the despatch, M. Dampierre told each
guest to fill his glass; then, lifting his own, “To the
victory of the King, and the extermination of the rebels!”
he cried. “Drink with me, gentlemen.”</p>

<p>“To the victory of the King, and the extermination of
the rebels!” cried all, with one voice.</p>

<p>But before they had time to put the glasses to their lips,
a furious gallop, coming from the direction of Paris, was
heard; and, shouting with joy, a horseman, with a tricolor
in his hat, shot past like a whirlwind, crying to M. Dampierre
and his friends these words—not less terrible than
those that Belshazzar read, in letters of fire, on the wall,—“The
Bastille is taken! Long live the people!”</p>

<p>The horseman was Jean Baptiste Drouet, who was riding
at full speed to announce to his friends at Varennes the
news of the victory that the people had obtained over their
King.</p>

<p>This news which he proclaimed in every city and in every
village that he passed, brightened his route with a flash
vivid as lightning.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII.<br>
<span class="fs70">CONCERNING THE BASTILLE.</span></h2>


<p>All France gave one cry of joy when the news arrived
that the Bastille was taken.</p>

<p>All the world knew the Bastille—that prison which has
given its name to others.</p>

<p>From one end of France to the other, all shook hands,
congratulating each other on the event.</p>

<p>And, strange to say, the Bastille was taken by those who
had never entered it—in fact, it was a place of imprisonment
for nobles only.</p>

<p>One would have thought, from the fact of their attacking
it, that it was a place which they themselves had to dread.</p>

<p>Ah! it was a horrible den. You were not dead there;
but what was worse, you were forgotten.</p>

<p>Your father, wife, or brother dared not speak of you, for
fear they should be sent there likewise.</p>

<p>Once there, you no longer had a name, but a number.
You died, and they buried you under a false name.</p>

<p>No; the King did not deprive you of your head; he
was too good for that; he only forgot you.</p>

<p>Instead of dying in a moment, you suffered unutterable
tortures for perhaps thirty years.</p>

<p>In the reign of Louis XVI all the rigors of prisons were
softened, with the exception of the Bastille, the discipline
of which was harsher than ever. In former reigns they
had barred the windows; but now they also stopped the
promenades in the gardens.</p>

<p>It is true that Louis XVI did not actually do this himself
but he suffered it to be done, which is all the same.</p>

<p>Louis XVI did not himself shut up the garden. No; it
was De Launay, who was as unpopular as he well could be.</p>

<p>At the Bastille all bought the places that they occupied,
from the Governor down to the gaolers. Every situation
was worth having, except that of the prisoners.</p>

<p>The Governor had sixty thousand livres salary. He
made a hundred and twenty thousand by his plunders.</p>

<p>We have already spoken of the garden of the Bastille<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[49]</span>
open to the prisoners. It was but a little plot of ground,
planted, as it were, upon a bastion.</p>

<p>A gardener offered a hundred francs a year for it; and
this scoundrel, who was wringing from the pitiful allowances
of the prisoners the sum of a hundred and twenty thousand
francs per annum, actually, for the sake of this paltry sum,
deprived the poor wretches under his rule of the breath of
air that made life supportable, of the sole gleam of life that
intervened ’twixt them and the tomb.</p>

<p>He well knew that he would never survive the capture of
the Bastille—this man of iron, who had a Bastille in place
of a heart.</p>

<p>The Governor’s hundred and thirty-five barrels of powder
were placed in a vault, situated in the centre of the fortress.
The Bastille blown into the air would astound Paris in its
ascent, and utterly destroy it in its stupendous fall. This
he knew. When the prison was entered by the people,
he clapped a torch to the touch-string. An Invalide seized
his arms; two sous-officers crossed bayonets across his
breast. He snatched a knife from his belt; they took it out
of his hands.</p>

<p>Then he demanded to be allowed to march out with the
honors of war.</p>

<p>This demand met with a positive refusal.</p>

<p>At last, he would be satisfied were he allowed to depart
with life alone.</p>

<p>Two of the conquerors of the Bastille—Hullin and Elie—promised
this in the name of all.</p>

<p>He begged them to conduct him to the <span lang="fr">Hotel de Ville</span>,
where he had some shadow of authority.</p>

<p>In the meantime, whilst the people were dashing themselves
against the granite and the oak, and demolishing the
two stone slaves that supported the clock, and breaking
open the dungeons, with the intention of liberating the
prisoners confined therein, Hullin and Elie took away De
Launay, hiding him as much as possible by placing themselves
in front of him.</p>

<p>But when he arrived at the gates, the Governor was recognised.
He had no hat; Hullin, fearless of consequences,
gave him his own.</p>

<p>Turning into the Rue St. Antoine, one who had taken
part in the combat, recognised the prisoner.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[50]</span></p>

<p>Farther on, came some who had not yet been engaged in
the siege, and who, as a matter of course, were more bloodthirsty
now that the danger was over. They wished to
massacre the prisoners. De Launay remained alive through
the protection of Hullin and Elie.</p>

<p>Elie, less powerful than Hullin, was carried away by the
crowd, amongst whom he was lost sight of.</p>

<p>At the Arcade St. Jean, Hullin himself lost sight of De
Launay, but by a superhuman effort he separated the
crowd, and regained him. He dragged him to some adjacent
steps, but in the effort fell. Twice did he again raise
himself, only to fall again. At the third time, De Launay
had disappeared. He looked for him on all sides, and at last
recognised his head fixed on the extremity of a pike, and
borne above the crowd.</p>

<p>That head Hullin would have saved, had it been possible,
at the risk of his own.</p>

<p>During this time, the mob had released the prisoners in
the Bastille.</p>

<p>There were nine.</p>

<p>Two or three, on seeing the door open, cried out that the
people had come to slay them, and prepared to defend themselves
with chairs, but the intruders cried out in a loud
voice, “Free! Free!”</p>

<p>One could not understand it, and fell suffocating, pressing
his heart with his two hands.</p>

<p>Another stood speechless, with his eyes fixed on space; a
venerable man was he, with a white beard descending to his
breast. They took him for a spectre.</p>

<p>The conquerors told him that he was free.</p>

<p>He understood them not.</p>

<p>“How is Louis the Fifteenth?” asked he.</p>

<p>“He has been dead fifteen years.”</p>

<p>“How long had he been in the Bastille?” they asked
him.</p>

<p>“I know nothing about it,” he replied.</p>

<p>“Who are you?”</p>

<p>“I am the Elder-born of Space.”</p>

<p>He was mad.</p>

<p>Under the staircase, in a sort of tomb, they found two
skeletons. Who were they? No one knew. The workmen
took them away, and buried them in the Cemetery of
St. Paul.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[51]</span></p>

<p>All the world wished to see the Bastille. They showed
Latude’s ladder, that immense work of patience and of
genius.</p>

<p>For a month the old place was not emptied.</p>

<p>They heard sighs. A report ran about that there were
hidden dungeons known only to the Government, in which
the unhappy prisoners were suffered to die of hunger.</p>

<p>The architect of the city, Citizen Palloy, was ordered to
pull down the old fortress. Of the best stones, he made
eighty-six models of the Bastille, which he sent to eighty-six
different departments.</p>

<p>With the others, he built the <span lang="fr">Pont de la Revolution</span>, on
which the head of Louis XVI was exposed after execution.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII.<br>
<span class="fs70">THE DUKE D’ENGHIEN’S LAST DAY’S SPORT.</span></h2>


<p>For a long time, reports of hidden dungeons and forgotten
prisoners agitated Paris. Paris had had a mountain on
its breast, and could not accustom itself to the deliverance
from it.</p>

<p>To pity succeeded fear. Had they really escaped from
that calamity with which De Launay had threatened them?
They reported that there were underground passages from
the Bastille to Vincennes; and that in those passages the
powder was concealed just under the Faubourg St. Antoine,
which would one day blow up from one end to the other.</p>

<p>These fears had a good effect. They, for a time, dissipated
the feeling of famine which was gradually creeping
over Paris.</p>

<p>Foulon said, “The French have no bread; why should
they not eat hay? My horses eat it.”</p>

<p>True or not, he expiated this sneer with his life, and they
carried his head about with a mouthful of hay stuffed between
his teeth.</p>

<p>But, alas! it seemed that the French people had nothing
to do but to eat what Foulon recommended.</p>

<p>From Paris, the fear of famine was dispersed among the
provinces.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[52]</span></p>

<p>“Foulon,” said all, “had predicted it.”</p>

<p>They must mow all France.</p>

<p>All said that his ghost appeared to execute the menace.</p>

<p>Then report went about that bands of robbers had been
seen mowing the green wheat.</p>

<p>The municipality of Soissons wrote to the Assembly a
letter full of fears. “The robbers had cut,” they said, “all
the wheat for miles around, and were now marching on the
city.”</p>

<p>Soissons demanded help.</p>

<p>The Assembly sent a thousand men, who searched on all
sides, twelve miles a-day. They could not find the
robbers.</p>

<p>No matter, ten, twenty, a hundred people had seen them.</p>

<p>In the midst of this disputed news, other transpired
which was but too true.</p>

<p>A certain lord having heard that De Launay had wished
to blow up the Bastille, resolved, if it were in his power, to
complete that which the Governor had been unable to do.</p>

<p>He announced that, in honor of the taking of the Bastille,
he would give a grand entertainment, to which all
were invited—workmen, artisans, tradesmen, countrymen,
soldiers, women, old men, and children.</p>

<p>In this time of famine, when all lived on an ounce or
two of bread per diem, a good dinner was a public service.
Everybody—about 5,000 persons, that is to say—rushed to
the fête. In the midst of it, an explosion was heard, and
the surrounding plain was covered with dissevered limbs.</p>

<p>The gentleman, whose name was Mennay de Quincy,
escaped to Switzerland, and avoided punishment.</p>

<p>Later on, he returned; and, as he was a member of Parliament,
he was arraigned before it, and acquitted.</p>

<p>But the breach between the nobles and the people was
now opened. The poor Count de Haus, who was incapable
of committing such a crime, was accused of abetting M. de
Quincy.</p>

<p>Some days afterwards, being at Neuville le Pont, he was
insulted by the people, who proceeded to extremities; and
he had but just time to spring on his horse, and gallop off
to a place of safety.</p>

<p>Fear had now seized upon us, as well as every one else.</p>

<p>On the 18th of July, four days after the taking of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>[53]</span>
Bastille, the Prince Condé, the Duke d’Enghien, M. Vaudrevil,
and M. de Broglie were announced.</p>

<p>Their arrival astonished my uncle, as it was not the hunting
season; the wood being very thick, the shooting was
difficult.</p>

<p>The Prince de Condé replied that he only wished to hunt
a stag, the King having commanded him, in the possibility
of a war, to examine into the condition of the defences of
Verdun.</p>

<p>The courier was ordered to procure horses from Clermont,
and to command the two carriages punctually at five
o’clock.</p>

<p>So, taking this view of the matter, there was nothing extraordinary
in it at all.</p>

<p>The Princes, mindful of the sport they had had, were determined
to enjoy another day of it, although it was not
the proper season; but they could surely do as they liked.</p>

<p>The Duke d’Enghien commanded me to accompany
them.</p>

<p>I said good-bye to my books for the day, took the gun
which the Duke had given me, and followed them.</p>

<p>The Prince was then eighteen years of age—not much
older than I was. It was probably on account of the similarity
of our ages, that I was favored by so much of his notice.</p>

<p>I remarked that, though courteous as usual, he was profoundly
sorrowful.</p>

<p>He asked me what progress I was making in my education.</p>

<p>I told him. When I mentioned M. Drouet, he asked if
he were not the postmaster at St. Menehould.</p>

<p>On my response in the affirmative, “A hot Republican,
if I mistake not?” he said.</p>

<p>I replied that, through him, this part of the country had
been apprized of the capture of the Bastille.</p>

<p>He asked me some questions about the general disposition
of the country—as much of the nobles as of the lower
classes.</p>

<p>I told him that the love of the people for their King was
great, and that they equally hated the nobles, which was
true.</p>

<p>He covered his face with his handkerchief, and sighed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span></p>

<p>I looked at him with astonishment.</p>

<p>“Pardon me, Duke,” said I; “but I heard the Prince de
Condé say that he was going to inspect the fortifications of
Verdun, in case of war.”</p>

<p>He looked at me to see what I was driving at.</p>

<p>“Excuse my question, Duke,” said I, “but do you think
it probable that we shall have war?”</p>

<p>“Very probable,” said he, looking at me in his turn.
“But why that question?”</p>

<p>“Because, in that event, your Grace, I shall not have
lost my time.”</p>

<p>“What would you do if there were war?”</p>

<p>“If France be menaced, every one capable of bearing a
musket should fly to its defence.”</p>

<p>He looked at my gun. It was the one which he had
given me.</p>

<p>“So you can not only carry a gun, but you know how to
use it.”</p>

<p>“In fact, your Grace,” said I, laughing, “thanks to your
noble gift, I am such a capital shot, that if I had a Prussian
or Austrian at the end of it, I fancy they would pass
an uncomfortable quarter of an hour.”</p>

<p>“You think so?”</p>

<p>“I am certain of it. A Prussian or an Austrian would
be bigger than that pigeon you see there.”</p>

<p>And I pointed to one perched about three hundred paces
off, on the dry branch of a tree.</p>

<p>“You are mad,” said the Prince. “That bird is three
times out of range.”</p>

<p>“Certainly, your Grace, for shot; but not for ball?”</p>

<p>“Your gun is loaded, then, with ball?”</p>

<p>“Yes, your Grace; I seldom use anything else.”</p>

<p>“What are you doing, Henri?” the Prince de Condé
said, as he appeared in view.</p>

<p>“Nothing, father,” replied the Duke; “I am only saying
a few words to this boy here.”</p>

<p>He then bade me farewell, saying that he hoped I would
always “think of him kindly.” And waving his hand, he
resumed his seat by his father’s side, and disappeared.</p>

<p>I stood almost heart-broken on the spot where the Prince
addressed his last words to me.</p>

<p>One would have thought that I had a presentiment of the
awful circumstances under which I should meet him again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>[55]</span></p>

<p>All the towns had organized national guards, after the
example of Paris. Châlons had set the example; St. Menehould
had followed it. M. Drouet was captain. He came
to ask Bertrand to be his lieutenant, and to see how many
men he could recruit at Islettes.</p>

<p>It was the report of bandits having been seen about
which induced them to organize the National Guard.</p>

<p>In eight days, all France was armed. Each day the
National Assembly gave audiences to ten couriers. It had
at its disposal a million of men.</p>

<p>Drouet and Bertrand took a stroll in the village of Islettes.</p>

<p>They enrolled twenty men.</p>

<p>The keepers of the Forest of Argonne enlisted themselves
and formed that part of the brigade of which Father Descharmes
was chief.</p>

<p>I wished to be one of M. Bertrand’s detachment, consequently
in M. Drouet’s company.</p>

<p>He accompanied me as far as Father Descharmes’ cottage,
and asked me about the visit of the evening before.</p>

<p>He also asked if the Princes had not returned.</p>

<p>“No; because they have gone to Verdun,” said I.</p>

<p>“Why did they not send to hire their horses from my
place?”</p>

<p>“Because they preferred to have them from Clermont.”</p>

<p>“Hum!” said M. Jean Baptiste. “Do you know who
they were who accompanied the Duke d’Enghien and the
Prince de Condé?”</p>

<p>“I heard them mention M. Vandreul and M. Broglie.”</p>

<p>“Exactly,” said he. “Réné, they come not to inspect
Verdun. They have abandoned the King, and quitted
France. They have gone to intrigue with strangers.”</p>

<p>Then I remembered the sadness of the Duke d’Enghien;
and I called to mind his peculiar look, when I said that an
Austrian or Prussian were easier to shoot than a pigeon. I
also remembered his last words before leaving—“I hope
that you will always think of me with kindness.”</p>

<p>Poor Prince! He had left France, and that was the
cause of his sorrow.</p>

<p>“Would that all would follow his example,” murmured
M. Drouet, “from the first to the last! But,” continued
he, grinding his teeth, “I fancy that if the King or Queen
were to try that move, they would not escape so easily.”</p>

<span class="fs70">I GO TO MAKE CAPTIVES AND AM TAKEN CAPTIVE MYSELF.</span></h2>


<p>Our National Guard was at first a curious sight.</p>

<p>The first rank were armed with guns; the second with
scythes; the third with clubs, and so on.</p>

<p>Later on, the armorers made some pikes for those who
had no guns.</p>

<p>But however the guard was armed, there is no doubt but
that it was filled with enthusiasm.</p>

<p>Not a man, had he received the order, would have hesitated
to march on Paris.</p>

<p>What was most remarkable, with regard to this corps,
was the manner in which the battalions seemed, as it were,
to spring from the earth. Liberty was as yet quite young;
and yet she had only to strike with her foot on the ground,
to raise this deadly harvest of men.</p>

<p>It was in the sainted year of 1789 that all France became
soldiers. After the 14th July, every Frenchman was born
with teeth ready to bite a cartridge.</p>

<p>Villages and towns joined in one compact; and that was,
to mutually help each other when necessary.</p>

<p>One day, we saw arrive, by way of Clermont, the people
of Verdun; and, by way of Paris, the people of St. Menehould.</p>

<p>They had heard that a band of robbers had issued from
the Forest of Argonne, set fire to Islettes, and plundered
the village.</p>

<p>A hundred men from Clermont, under the command of
M. Mathieu, and two hundred from St. Menehould, under
M. Drouet, had therefore set out, to render what assistance
they might in the extermination of the brigands, of whom
they had as yet not seen a trace.</p>

<p>They made merry, therefore, instead of fighting, and in
the place of the rattle of musketry, was heard the more
peaceful song.</p>

<p>Eight days afterwards, a man passed on horseback, going
from Clermont to St. Menehould, and crying out, “The
brigands are marching on Varennes! Help! help!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a>[57]</span></p>

<p>The man disappeared from view—none knew him. No
matter, all leaped up; the drum beat the rappel; fifty men
put themselves under the direction of Bertrand; and, without
inquiring the number of the enemy, marched to Varennes.
Needless to say, I was one of them.</p>

<p>From the height of the hill of Veuvilly, we saw a great
cloud of dust, about half a league ahead of us.</p>

<p>They were the men of Clermont, who, having started
about half an hour before us, were about half a league
ahead.</p>

<p>At that sight, all elevated their hats on the ends of their
muskets or pikes, and shouted “<span lang="fr">Vive la nation!</span>”</p>

<p>That cry had almost completely taken the place of “Vive
le Roi!”</p>

<p>We arrived at Varennes, which we expected to find in
flames, with the streets running blood. From the height
of the hill, which descends to the <span lang="fr">Rue des Réligieuses</span>, we
had a good view of the town.</p>

<p>All was quiet.</p>

<p>The people of Clermont, when they first arrived, were
taken for the brigands, whom they were expecting every
moment.</p>

<p>When they recognised them, there was a general embracing,
and crying “<span lang="fr">Vive la nation!</span>”</p>

<p>Then we arrived, in our turn; and two hours afterwards,
the men of Montfalcon, De Bousance, and De Vouziez.
The latter had marched eight leagues in five hours.</p>

<p>They bivouacked in the <span lang="fr">Place de Latry</span>, and the <span lang="fr">Place
de Grand Monarque</span>.</p>

<p>They then laid out tables for a public repast, where, after
an ancient custom, each one chose his companions, and
found his own dinner.</p>

<p>I had one visit to pay in Varennes—a place to which I
seldom came, and where I only knew two persons, M. Guillaume
and M. Billaud.</p>

<p>I remembered me of one of the two master workmen
who had priced my carpentry work for M. Drouet; and
who said that if I had no work to do, and would accept it
of him, he could always find me plenty.</p>

<p>His name was Father Gerbaut.</p>

<p>I asked his address. He lived in the <span lang="fr">Rue de la Basse
Cour</span>. The houses were not numbered at that period. On<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>[58]</span>
the left, descending to the <span lang="fr">Place Latry</span>, next door to a large
grocer’s, his house was situated.</p>

<p>I called. He was out; but expected home every
moment.</p>

<p>I was received by his daughter, a charming girl, a little
younger than myself—that is to say, about sixteen or
seventeen years of age.</p>

<p>She asked me to wait till her father returned, or to give
her my name if I feared becoming weary of staying with
her.</p>

<p>Of course, I rejected with scorn the idea that any one
could become wearied in the presence of one so gracious
and charming.</p>

<p>It was the first time in my life that I had ever addressed
a compliment to a female.</p>

<p>Indeed, it was the first time that I had been in conversation
with a girl at all.</p>

<p>Up to this time, I had scarcely given women a moment’s
consideration.</p>

<p>Directly I told my name to the young girl, her face,
which had before been amiable, brightened into a look of
friendship.</p>

<p>“I know you,” said she; “you worked for M. Drouet;
my father has mentioned you to his workmen, more than
once, as an example to be followed. Do stay; he will be
glad to see you.”</p>

<p>On looking around me, I perceived a harpsichord.</p>

<p>“You are a musician, I perceive, mademoiselle.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Monsieur Réné, you must not call me that. The
organist of St. Gengoulf has given me a few lessons; and,
as he says I have some voice, I practise singing to amuse
myself.”</p>

<p>“Mademoiselle,” said I, “can you believe that I have
never heard the sound of a harpsichord, or any song, but
that of the washerwomen, as they beat their linen? Will
you sing something for me as well as yourself, and I shall
be completely happy?”</p>

<p>“With the greatest pleasure,” she replied.</p>

<p>And rising up, she crossed over to the harpsichord; and,
after a simple prelude, she sang—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indentq">“How sad to me the day</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">When thou art far away!”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>[59]</span></p>
<p>Every one knows that pretty romance, the “Devin de
Village.”</p>

<p>But it had never seemed so charming to me as when
issuing from the lips of my pretty songstress.</p>

<p>Mademoiselle Gerbaut had sang very simply, but with
that coquetry so natural to women. Her face was variable;
and as she sang without accompaniment, leaning slightly
back in her chair, her half-closed eyes gave a somewhat
sentimental expression to the rest of her face. Her mouth
was beautifully formed, she spoke almost without any perceptible
movement of the lips, and you saw, at the first
glance, that what she said was neither artificial nor constrained.</p>

<p>I was delighted with her. I said nothing, but my looks
spoke more than words could have done.</p>

<p>“Mademoiselle,” said I, not being able, in my enthusiasm,
to think of anything else, “have you read
‘Emile?’”</p>

<p>“No, monsieur,” she replied; “but my mother has read
it, and that is why I am named Sophie.”</p>

<p>“You are named Sophie!” cried I, seizing her hand,
and pressing it to my heart; “now I am completely
happy!”</p>

<p>She looked at me with an astonished smile.</p>

<p>“And why are you so happy because my name is
Sophie?” said she.</p>

<p>“Because now I can look upon you as a sister more than
a stranger. Oh, Sophie—dear Sophie!”</p>

<p>Sophie regarded me with a more astonished expression
of face than ever; and I know not what she might have
said, had not M. Gerbaut made his appearance at that
moment.</p>

<p>“Ah! is that you, Réné?” said he; “you are, indeed,
welcome. I asked the news from your friends on the
Place there, and when they told me that you were at Varennes,
I knew you would not go without calling to see me.”</p>

<p>“Yes, M. Gerbaut,” I answered, going up to him, and
shaking his hand; “but I did not expect to find what I
have found.”</p>

<p>“And, pray, what have you found?”</p>

<p>“Mademoiselle Sophie, who has been kind enough to
sing me an air from the ‘<span lang="fr">Devin de Village de M. Rousseau</span>.’”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[60]</span></p>

<p>“Ah, indeed! She did not require much persuasion, did
she?”</p>

<p>“Only great men, or great fools, require to be asked
twice,” said Sophie, laughing; “and as I am not a genius
or a ——-”</p>

<p>Here she paused, while a sweet smile played over her
lips.</p>

<p>“Fool,” continued M. Gerbaut, “you sang to him.”</p>

<p>“Did I do wrong, father?”</p>

<p>“Certainly not. As long as you sing to your equals,
and without affectation, well and good. You know what I
mean?”</p>

<p>Sophie bent her eyes, blushing.</p>

<p>“We must change our quarters, I think,” said Father
Gerbaut, half smiling, half serious.</p>

<p>“Wherefore?” said I, breaking into the conversation.</p>

<p>“Because we are just opposite to the ‘<span lang="fr">Hotel de Bras
d’Or</span>,’ where many handsome young gentlemen put up, and
who are fond of music as a vehicle for making love.”</p>

<p>“Oh, father!” murmured Sophie; “say not so!”</p>

<p>“What would you have?” cried M. Gerbaut. “They
are no friends of mine who would bring trouble into peaceful
families. When I understood that the princes and
great lords had left the country, I had hoped that these
gentlemen would have gone in their train. But no; they
stay to make love to our wives and daughters, and to conspire
against the nation. But this is not the time to speak
of that. This is a <i lang="fr">fête</i> day for Varennes. I must pay a
visit to the cellar and larder. After dinner we will have a
dance. Will you be Sophie’s partner?” said M. Gerbaut
to me.</p>

<p>“I should be only too happy,” cried I; “but perhaps
Mdlle. Sophie does not think a young apprentice worthy of
offering her his arm?”</p>

<p>“Oh, M. Réné!” said the young girl; “you listen to
my father, and then do me a grievous wrong, without any
foundation for it.”</p>

<p>Sophie and myself bounded down the staircase, and in a
moment found ourselves under a bright sun in the street,
as I could not help thinking, like two butterflies emerged
from a chrysalis state.</p>

<p>Whilst I had been waiting at M. Gerbaut’s, and whilst<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61"></a>[61]</span>
I had been listening to Sophie’s song, the streets of Varennes
had undergone a great change.</p>

<p>The city was holding high holiday, with which, however,
was mingled a certain degree of solemnity.</p>

<p>All the houses were hung with tapestry; and outside the
doors tables were laid, covered with flowers, at which the
inhabitants of the houses were seated, eating, waited upon
by their servants, if they had any; if not, by themselves.</p>

<p>As if they wished that the dead should participate in
the joy of the living, garlands of green boughs, intermingled
with flowers, were suspended from the gates of the
cemetery, which stretched from the church to the side of
the <span lang="fr">Rue de l’Horloge</span>. In the middle of the Place was
erected a scaffolding, filled with amateur musicians, who
wished to promote a dance after dinner. On the front of
this temple of Terpsichore was written “<span lang="fr">Vive le Roi!
Vive la nation!</span>” Underneath this, in large letters, was
inscribed the word “<span lang="fr">Fraternité!</span>”</p>

<p>It was, in fact a brotherly rejoicing. Those who there
met for the first time were members of one great family,
which had existed for centuries, only it ignored the tie
which bound one to the other.</p>

<p>But common danger had caused to meet the two ends of
the thread, and in their union they found force.</p>

<p>After passing the houses leading to the Place Latry, we
arrived at the open space in front of the <span lang="fr">Rue de l’Horloge</span>,
and entered into the midst of the crowd.</p>

<p>There seemed to be collected all the inhabitants of the
High Town.</p>

<p>In each street the tables were arranged on the right and
left side of the houses; a space in the middle being left for
the promenaders. The <span lang="fr">Rue des Réligieuses</span>, which runs
down from the foot of the hill, made a most perfect and
picturesque view.</p>

<p>We got mixed up with a lot of other persons, when all of
a sudden a crowd of horsemen—young gentlemen, apparently—appeared
on the crest of the hill, and, putting their
horses at full gallop, dashed into the <span lang="fr">Rue des Réligieuses</span>.
There was a general cry of “Each one for himself!” and
we turned to fly; but as we had been in front before, we
now naturally found ourselves in the rear.</p>

<p>Thinking but of Sophie, I wished to put her under one<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"></a>[62]</span>
of the tables, to be out of the way of danger; but curious
to relate, she did not seem to know the peril she was in,
and would not stir till it was too late; and I had just time
to clasp her in my arms, and throw myself in front of her.</p>

<p>I had scarcely accomplished this, than, on turning round,
I discovered myself face to face with a horseman, whose
steed was perfectly unmanageable, and turned round and
round, threatening us with his hoofs as he did so.</p>

<p>I had but one hope, and that was to preserve Sophie. I
caught hold of the horse’s bridle, the cavalier raised his
whip, the horse gave a plunge, and, whether through accident
or intention, the blow, instead of falling on the horse,
struck me on the shoulder.</p>

<p>The shame of being struck, more than the pain of the
blow, caused the blood to rise to my head. I seized the
horseman by his waist, lifted him from the saddle, the
horse bolting away at the moment, upsetting a woman and
two or three children in its wild career, and fell with him
on the pavement; but, being the more vigorous, I was the
uppermost, and soon had him at my mercy, with my knee
on his breast.</p>

<p>It was only when his hat fell from his head, that I recognised
who my adversary was.</p>

<p>“M. de Malmy!” cried I.</p>

<p>And taking my knee from his breast, and releasing his
arms, I stood a little on one side.</p>

<p>“Ah, wretch!” cried he regaining his whip. “Do you
know what is the penalty for laying hands on a gentleman?”</p>

<p>“M. le Viscount!” cried Sophie, pale with terror, placing
herself, at the same time, between us.</p>

<p>He smiled a grim smile, grinding his teeth as he did so.</p>

<p>“I am determined, mademoiselle. Had he been a
gentleman, I would chastise him with a sword; but as he
is not, I shall punish him with this whip.”</p>

<p>He raised it.</p>

<p>I looked for something with which to defend myself. At
that moment, a man sprang over one of the tables, seized
the Marquis with one hand, and possessed himself of the
whip with the other.</p>

<p>“Monsieur,” said he, “whips were made for horses and
dogs. Réné Besson is a man.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63"></a>[63]</span></p>

<p>“A man?” repeated the Viscount, furiously.</p>

<p>“Yes, a man; and one whom you may not insult.”</p>

<p>“Who are you?” asked the Viscount.</p>

<p>“You know me very well, M. de Malmy; but as you ask,
I will tell you. I am Jean Baptiste Drouet, postmaster at
St. Menehould. I am not of noble birth, I know full well;
but for six years have I served my country as a soldier, and
that is better than a gentleman who spends his life in eating,
drinking, and hunting. This I say for the benefit of
you and your friends, and if you want me, you know where
to find me.”</p>

<p>Saying these words, Drouet pushed De Malmy aside,
and turned to confront two or three other young gentlemen,
who, having dismounted, had come to join in the quarrel.</p>

<p>“When we change horses at your post-house, M. Drouet,”
said one of these young men, “we do not generally
approach, but send our domestics to bear our orders to
you.”</p>

<p>“I would much rather deal with your servants than with
you, M. de Courtement. They, at least, have not sold their
wives or daughters in the Parc au Cerfs.”</p>

<p>The young noble took this as a sarcasm on his birth,
with regard to which infamous reports had been bruited
about.</p>

<p>He had a hunting-knife in his belt, and suddenly drew
it, maddened with anger.</p>

<p>But before the knife could do any mischief, Drouet drew
a pistol from his pocket, and presented it full in the face of
the Chevalier.</p>

<p>“Monsieur,” said he, “I could shoot you like I would a
wild beast; and two hundred people would bear witness
that you offered the first insult; but the time has not
yet come when all shall have their dues. So go your way
in peace, and let the matter stand as it is.”</p>

<p>“Oh, without doubt, that proceeding would suit you
wonderfully well,” said M. de Malmy; “but, for the sake
of an example, I must proceed otherwise.”</p>

<p>Raising his whip, he advanced on M. Drouet, who, making
a spring to one side, jumped on a table, and cried out,
in a powerful tone of voice, “Help! To my assistance,
men of St. Menehould!”</p>

<p>A hundred voices responded to the cry; a crowd rushed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>[64]</span>
to where we were; and in a moment, the five or six gentlemen
were completely in our power.</p>

<p>Each had seized the arms that came nearest to hand—one
a pike, another a musket; thus showing by their alacrity,
their wish to be of service to their commander. They
were informed of the origin of the dispute, and wished
nothing better than to fan up the embers of the old quarrel
between the nobles and the people.</p>

<p>The young gentlemen saw that it was useless to attempt
resistance.</p>

<p>“Murder us!” cried the Viscount; “even as your
friends at Paris have murdered De Launay, Foulon, and
Berthier.”</p>

<p>“Our friends, as you call them, in Paris, disgraced themselves
by laying hands on men who were scarcely good
enough to die by the hands of the common executioner.
But what would you have? The people have cried for justice,
and it has been denied them. Is it, then, wonderful
that they should take the law in their own hands when the
opportunity presented? But as for you, gentlemen, as you
are not gaolers, like De Launay, or extortioners, like Foulon
and Berthier, you have not merited death, but simply
a little lesson, which I shall have great pleasure in giving
you.”</p>

<p>“Give a lesson to us?” cried the young men, mad with
rage.</p>

<p>“Yes; but it shall not be harsh or spiteful. This is a
day of brotherly fraternity. Are you our brothers? Will
you share in our <i lang="fr">fête</i>? Forget the hard words that have
passed between us; or, if you cannot, put them down to
the account of that goddess who is aptly called Discord.
The tables await you. Sit down among us, and we will
give you the place of honor; and the first one who forgets
to pay the respect which is due to you, shall be chased from
the midst of us, as one unworthy of participating in our
reunion. Do you agree with me?” cried Drouet to all
who were around.</p>

<p>“Yes! yes!” replied all, with one voice, with the exception
of the young nobles, who still continued silent.</p>

<p>“What if we refuse?” at last said one of them.</p>

<p>“If you refuse,” said Drouet, “go to the ‘Bras d’Or,’
or the ‘Grand Monarque;’ eat and drink as you like—you<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65"></a>[65]</span>
are free; but disturb not our enjoyment. Am I not right,
my friends?” continued Drouet, for the second time addressing
the crowd.</p>

<p>The applause was as loud as before.</p>

<p>“And if we do not promise to leave you in quiet enjoyment
of your <i lang="fr">fête</i>—what then?” asked another of the
young nobles.</p>

<p>“As, by that act, you will prove that you are not good
citizens, and that you are desirous of breaking the public
peace, we shall ask you to leave the town quietly; and; if
you refuse, we will expel you by force.”</p>

<p>“Bravo! bravo!” cried all.</p>

<p>M. de Malmy interrogated his companions with his
eyes; and as he saw the same expression in all theirs,
“Messieurs,” said he, “I regret that, in the name of my
friend and myself, I must refuse the great honor that you
offer us. I regret, also, that we cannot pledge our word
not to interrupt the <i lang="fr">fête</i>, as we are not sufficient philosophers
to avoid breaking our promise; so—as we have no
further business to detain us in town—we ask your permission
to make our most respectful adieu, and to go and
seek our pleasure elsewhere.”</p>

<p>“As you wish, M. le Viscount,” said M. Drouet. “You
are free to go.” Then, assuming the tone of command
which sat so well on him, he said, “Allow these gentlemen
to pass, and preserve complete silence; the one who passes
a remark, will have to answer for it to me.”</p>

<p>Not a sound could be heard.</p>

<p>In the midst of this oppressive silence, the young nobles
remounted their horses, and returned by the way that they
had arrived.</p>

<p>No word was spoken, no movement made; but the
people followed the little party with their eyes until they
finally disappeared from view on turning into the road
leading to Clermont.</p>

<p>Then a voice was heard, calm, but commanding in its
tones. It was Drouet’s.</p>

<p>“Lieutenant Bertrand,” said he, “place sentinels at the
gates and see that the young nobles do not re-enter the
town, during the continuance of the <i lang="fr">fête</i>.”</p>

<p>Then, turning to the crowd, “Am I not right, my
friends?” said he.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[66]</span></p>

<p>“<span lang="fr">Vive M. Drouet! Vive la nation!</span>” cried the people,
with one voice.</p>

<p>A few cries of “Down with the nobles!” were heard,
but they had no response. In fact, Drouet turned to
whence those cries proceeded, and made a gesture of
disapprobation.</p>

<p>The <i lang="fr">fête</i> then continued as happily as if nothing had
happened.</p>

<span class="fs70">TOUCHING MADEMOISELLE SOPHIE.</span></h2>


<p>I have said how much my encounter with De Malmy
seemed to affect my companion, but that might have been
accounted for in three ways. First, her fear for herself;
second, her fear for me; and lastly, perhaps, her fear for
my adversary.</p>

<p>I had not forgotten what Father Gerbaut had said with
regard to his daughter’s looking higher than her position
warranted, and to the attention which she drew from the
young gentlemen who put up at the “Bras d’Or,” some of
whom were, no doubt, those with whom we had been in
contest.</p>

<p>I had naturally followed, with my eyes, the little cavalcade,
until it finally disappeared.</p>

<p>On withdrawing my looks from it, I perceived that
Sophie was half fainting. I offered her my arm, which
she took, trembling at the same time all over.</p>

<p>“Oh, M. Réné,” said she, “I was so frightened! How
glad I am that it ended as it did!”</p>

<p>For whom was she frightened? and for whose sake was
she so glad that all was over?</p>

<p>Was it for our sakes, or for that of the young lords?</p>

<p>I did not like to ask her.</p>

<p>M. Drouet walked along the Place with us. We passed
under the arch, and entered the <span lang="fr">Rue de la Basse Cour</span>.
Billaud lived some distance away, and Guillaume almost in
the country; so those three young men went to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67"></a>[67]</span>
“<span lang="fr">Hotel du Bras d’Or</span>,” and although the brothers Leblanc wished
to give them a dinner for nothing, they insisted on paying
for everything that they had.</p>

<p>The table at which they dined was on the other side of
the street, just opposite to ours.</p>

<p>The clock of St. Gengoulf gave the signal for dinner.</p>

<p>The two first toasts proposed were “The King!” and
“The nation!” They then drank another “To the health
of those who, believing them to be in danger, had flown to
their succor.”</p>

<p>Sophie ate but little, in spite of my remonstrances. Now
and then, her father broke out into violent abuse against
the young nobles, and I saw the tears trembling on her eyelashes
every time that he did so.</p>

<p>We crossed the bridge thrown over the River Aire. Two
streams of promenaders were continually passing—the one
set mounting up, the other coming down. The Place du
Grand Monarque was splendidly illuminated. The tables
were not in any one’s way, being, for the most part, piled
in front of the door of the church.</p>

<p>The <span lang="fr">Place du Grand Monarque</span> being smoother and
better paved than the Place Latry and, besides, not having
the dispiriting influence of a cemetery, was chosen for the
ball room.</p>

<p>The signal for the dance was given by a joyous peal from
the church bells, to which violins and clarionets replied, and
a quadrille was speedily formed.</p>

<p>My partner took my arm for the second dance, but suddenly
complaining of illness, she implored me to take her
home.</p>

<p>I was not an experienced dancer, but under Sophie’s tuition
I got on so well, that I tried all I could to dissuade her
from retiring; but she said, with a sad smile, “Do not ask
me to remain, Réné,” and so I was obliged to comply with
her request.</p>

<p>I gave her my arm, and we retraced our steps to the
house.</p>

<p>M. Gerbaut had heard all about the fracas in the Rue des
Réligieuses, and was very well pleased that we had given
the young gentlemen a lesson.</p>

<p>Sophie, who had her arm in mine, heard all that he said
to me, with downcast eyes, and gave no sign of approbation
or otherwise, but I felt her shudder under her father’s words.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[68]</span></p>

<p>As I was leaving, “Mademoiselle,” said I, “I go back
to-morrow, with my friends, probably before you awake; so
permit me to say good-bye this evening, and to tell you before
M. Gerbaut, what pleasure I feel in having made your
acquaintance.”</p>

<p>“And I, M. Réné,” said she, “like you as a friend, and
am well disposed to love you as a brother.”</p>

<p>“Very well, my children,” said Father Gerbaut, “embrace
each other and say good-bye.”</p>

<p>Sophie turned to me both cheeks, which I kissed with a
feeling of ineffable pleasure.</p>

<p>She then retired to her own room; I followed her with
my eyes to the door, when she turned, and gave me a parting
glance, and a parting smile.</p>

<p>“She is a good girl, after all,” said her father.</p>

<p>“A good girl, M. Gerbaut? Say, rather, an angel!”</p>

<p>“Angels are not so common as all that, my boy. But,”
continued he, leading me along the corridor, and opening a
door, “here is your room, not only for to-night, but for
ever, if you will enter into my service. You shall have
board and lodging, and twenty-five crowns a month. Do
you hear me?”</p>

<p>I shook him by the hand, and thanked him for his kindness.
He then wished me to come down stairs again, to
drink a glass to the health of the nation. But I pleaded
fatigue, and want of sleep, and entered my chamber.</p>

<p>The real reason why I did not comply with his offer, was
that I wished to be alone.</p>

<p>I shut the door, for I was afraid that any one might come
and look for me. But there was no fear of that. Every
one was so busy enjoying himself, that they had no time to
think of aught else.</p>

<p>I threw myself on the bed, and thought of Sophie.</p>

<p>M. Drouet had given me a sincere liking for intellectual
existence, but Sophie awakened in me another kind of existence,
that of love; and I felt, for the first time, that indescribable,
but pleasurable sensation, which predicts the
dawning of that passion.</p>

<p>A new future opened before me. This was the scene.
A happy, though, perhaps, a humble home, with a careful
and a beloved wife. I could see myself, at set of sun,
walking by the river’s side, her heart beating against mine.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69"></a>[69]</span>
I could fancy delaying under the tall trees, to hear the
blackbird’s song. In a word, this dream of the future was
that twofold life which, till then, had never engaged my
boyish thoughts. Now, I seemed to have taken one step
into this fairyland; and, although I trembled still, I would
fain go on.</p>

<p>What, then, prevented me, I asked myself, from making
this dream a reality? Why did I not at once close with
M. Gerbaut’s offer? It was because my heart misgave me.
I thought of Sophie’s evident leaning towards men of a
higher class; I reflected that, to her, I must be a mere boy.
And I groaned in spirit that I was not half a dozen years
older.</p>

<p>At daybreak, the reveillé was beaten. My comrade had
passed the night on the Place and in the streets, dancing
and drinking. I jumped from my couch, and, having hastily
dressed myself, crept on tip-toe to the door of Sophie’s
chamber, wishing to say adieu, even if only through the
key-hole.</p>

<p>I had trodden as lightly as possible, scarcely hearing my
own footsteps; and how great was my astonishment on
seeing the door open a little way, and a hand put out.</p>

<p>It was easy to see, through the crevice from which the
hand was protruded, that Sophie had not retired to rest at
all; or, if she had, that she had not undressed herself.</p>

<p>I seized the hand, and pressed it to my lips.</p>

<p>She withdrew it, leaving, at the same time, a little billet
in mine, and quickly closed the door.</p>

<p>I could scarcely believe my eyes. I approached a window,
and, by the light of early dawn, read these words:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I have no friends, Réné. Be one to me. I am very
unhappy!”</p>
</div>

<p>I pressed, with one hand, the billet to my heart, and,
with the other extended towards her chamber, I swore to
accept and prove myself worthy of the friendship so mysteriously
offered.</p>

<p>Then, perceiving that all was quiet in her room, I went
down stairs, took my gun, and, throwing one parting glance
at her window, passed into the street.</p>

<p>The curtain drew back, giving me a glimpse of her face.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70"></a>[70]</span>
She nodded, throwing me a sad smile, and the curtain was
replaced before the window.</p>

<p>Small as the time was that I had for observation, I could
not help thinking that her eyes were reddened with weeping.</p>

<p>There was nothing wonderful in that. Had she not told
me, in her letter, that she was very unhappy?</p>

<p>There was a mystery, which, no doubt, thought I, time
will clear up.</p>

<p>I walked rapidly down the street, in the direction of the
Place, knowing that, if I did not make a vigorous effort, I
should never be able to tear myself away from the vicinity
of the house.</p>

<p>The men of Clermont, D’Islettes, and St. Menehould—in
fact, all who followed the same route—were collected in
one group. They drank one last toast, shook hands for the
last time, and separated.</p>

<p>Father Gerbaut conducted us as far as the top of the
Hill <span lang="fr">des Réligieuses</span>, and there renewed the offers that he
had previously made to me.</p>

<p>I reached Father Descharmes’ cottage, and, for the first
time, found it lonely, and my room wretched.</p>

<p>On the morrow, I re-commenced my usual routine of life;
and though I had the same wish to make progress in my
studies, still there was a dreary blank in my heart, which
they could not fill.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI.<br>
<span class="fs70">WHAT “BROTHERHOOD” MEANT.</span></h2>


<p>I have told you all that took place up to this time.</p>

<p>My life continued the same as ever, with the exception
of a dreary feeling about the heart.</p>

<p>The events that took place in Paris had no direct effect
upon me. I heard them as one might hear the echo of a
distant thunder-clap.</p>

<p>In this way we heard of the abolition of titles, on the
1st of August; of the suppression of tithes; of the recognition<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71"></a>[71]</span>
of religious liberty; of the orgie of the <span lang="fr">gardes du
corps</span>; of the insult offered to the national cockade; of the
days of the 5th and 6th of October; of the return of the
King and Queen to Paris; of the plots and intrigues of
the Court; of the prosecution of Bezenval and Favras;
and of the publication of the Red Book by the assembly.</p>

<p>The Red Book revealed all.</p>

<p>The King, who had, on the 12th of February, sworn
friendship to the Constitution, not only was in direct correspondence
with the exiles, but went to Trêves, a military
post, where his stables were situated, and which was in
charge of Prince Lambese, the very man who had charged
on the people in the garden of the Tuileries, on the 12th
of July, and wounded an old man with his sabre, and trodden
the helpless under foot.</p>

<p>The same kind of thing went on at Versailles. The
King had a Minister of Foreign Affairs; uniforms were
made for the <span lang="fr">gardes du corps</span>, and sent to Trêves; horses
were bought in England for the accommodation of the
King’s household; and the only grumble that Louis XVI
made, when he paid the bills, was, that, at least, they might
have bought the horses in France.</p>

<p>The Comte D’Artois, the Prince Condé, and the other
exiles, received enormous pensions.</p>

<p>They had not then been able to find what became of the
sixty millions.</p>

<p>But now the Red Book pointed out where they had
gone.</p>

<p>If, up to this moment, there had been any hesitation on
the minds of the people, that hesitation now disappeared.</p>

<p>They knew where was their enemy.</p>

<p>The enemy was the exiles, and their ally, the King, who
pensioned them.</p>

<p>This was the reason why the Assembly struck a decisive
blow, and put up for sale, at one time, ecclesiastical benefices
to the tune of four hundred millions. Paris alone
bought two hundred millions’ worth.</p>

<p>All the municipalities followed that example. They
bought a great number, and then sold them, one by one.
In a word, they wished to expropriate the clergy, and
they did not hesitate to do it.</p>

<p>There is something miraculous in this, and which does
not appear in the history of any other country.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72"></a>[72]</span></p>

<p>And that is, the spontaneous organization of France by
itself. The Assembly was only a secretary. France did
the deed; the Assembly registered it.</p>

<p>Before that, the division of old France into provinces was
abolished; the boundaries had been already changed; there
were no longer Provençals, Bretons, Alsaciens, Picards, or
French.</p>

<p>The <span lang="fr">Champ de Mars</span> was Mount Tabor, transfigured by
the sun of June.</p>

<p>Valence gave, on the 29th of November, 1789, the example
of the first federation; and each strove to follow the
example given by the zealous Dauphin, our vanguard
against the great enemy, the Savoyard King.</p>

<p>From anterior ages, the eldest man has always presided,
whether noble or not. His age makes his right—his white
locks his crown.</p>

<p>Rouen searched for an old Chevalier of Malta, eighty-five
years of age, to preside at its federation.</p>

<p>In St. Audeol, there were two old men, respectively
ninety-three and ninety-four years of age, the one a noble,
and the other a plebeian—the one a colonel, the other a
laborer. These two embraced at the altar, and the spectators
embraced each other, crying, “There is no longer an
aristocracy, no longer a working-class—there are only
Frenchmen!”</p>

<p>At Lous le Lauheur, a citizen, whose name is forgotten,
gave this toast:—</p>

<p>“To all men, equally to our enemies: let us swear to
love and protect them.”</p>

<p>Open the book of royalty, and see if you can find a sentiment
equal to that inscribed on the first page of the book
of the people.</p>

<p>From all places, provincial and isolated, one cry arose:—
“To Paris! To Paris! To Paris!”</p>

<p>As this cry burst from the throat of France, Royalists
and Jacobins trembled. The Jacobins said, “The
King, with his smile, and the Queen, with her white lips,
will fascinate the credulous people from the provinces, and
will cause them to turn against us, and the revolution will
be at an end.”</p>

<p>The Royalists said, “To bring these provincials, already
ripe for tumult, to Paris, the centre of agitation, is but<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73"></a>[73]</span>
bringing oil to feed the lamp of revolution. Who can say
what will be the effect of this immense concourse, and what
fearful events may come to pass through the incursions of
two hundred and fifty thousand souls, from all quarters of
France, into Paris?”</p>

<p>But the impulse was given, and the movement could not
be stayed.</p>

<p>France wished, with that powerful will which nothing
could arrest, to know itself.</p>

<p>The corporation of Paris demanded of the Assembly the
general federation.</p>

<p>The Assembly, pretending to accord to their wish, named
the 14th of July, the anniversary of the taking of the
Bastille.</p>

<p>The news was propagated among all the provinces of the
kingdom; but as they feared so great an assemblage in
Paris, and wished to put all possible obstacles in their way,
all expenses were put down to the charge of the localities.</p>

<p>All our department clubbed together. I was comparatively
rich, having in my possession three or four hundred
crowns, gained by my own labor, and saved by my own
economy.</p>

<p>Father Descharmes had offered to give me what sum I
wanted; but I refused to accept anything.</p>

<p>For some time, the poor old man had been declining in
health. He had served princes all his life, and now missed
them. One thing greatly perplexed him, and that was,
whether France had the right to act as it was acting?</p>

<p>They had offered him a deputyship to the federation; but
he shook his head, saying, “I am too old; Réné will go in
my place.”</p>

<p>Afterwards, he had a long conversation with M. Drouet,
in the course of which he gave him some papers, which he
sorted with care, put in his portfolio, and took to St. Menehould.</p>

<p>On the eve of departure, a carriage drove up to the door
of my uncle’s cottage; and, to my astonishment, I saw
Sophie and her father alight from it.</p>

<p>I rushed out with a cry of joy, but suddenly stopped myself.</p>

<p>What would Sophie—what would her father think?</p>

<p>Father Gerbaut smiled. Sophie made a step in advance,
and gave me her hand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74"></a>[74]</span></p>

<p>“Well, how is old Nimrod getting on?” said Father
Gerbaut to my uncle, who had just come out of his room.</p>

<p>“As well as can be expected at my age, M. Gerbaut. It
is necessary for the violet to blossom in spring, and the
beech-tree to put forth its buds in May. He is just sixteen
and a half years old. When I was at that age, I already
had a sweetheart.”</p>

<p>I felt myself blushing to the very tips of my ears.</p>

<p>“Ah! I never had but one love. But where are you going
to in this fashion?” asked my uncle; “for I cannot
think that you came all this way on purpose to pay me a
visit.”</p>

<p>“No, my old friend; though I am delighted to see you. I
am on my way to St. Menehould, to put a few little affairs
of mine in order. I have been appointed a member of the
Federation, and I do not know how long we may be compelled
to stay in Paris.”</p>

<p>“What a pity that you have not got a third seat in your
carriage. I also have business at St. Menehould, and I would
have asked you to give me a lift.”</p>

<p>“Good!” said M. Gerbaut; “all can be arranged. Sophie
does not much care to go to St. Menehould. Do you,
Sophie?”</p>

<p>“I only care to go, so as to be with you, father.”</p>

<p>“Well, then, stay here with Réné. You can stroll, in
the wood, like two lovers, and we, like two old fogies as we
are, will go and look after our affairs. If Réné were a young
nobleman, I should not place so much trust in him; but he
is a good lad, a clever workman, and an honest man, and as
I would trust him with a purse, so will I trust him with my
child.”</p>

<p>I looked joyfully at Sophie, but she showed neither pleasure
nor sorrow; she seemed to be exactly of her father’s
opinion, that we might be trusted together.</p>

<p>M. Gerbaut and Father Descharmes got into the vehicle,
and drove off in the direction of the village of Islettes.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XII">CHAPTER XII.<br>
<span class="fs70">WHAT PASSED IN THE FOREST.</span></h2>


<p>For some time I followed the carriage with my eyes, for
I feared to look at Sophie, as I could not help thinking
that the expression of her face would decide my future
happiness or misery.</p>

<p>After a time I made up my mind; I turned round.</p>

<p>Sophie had a smile on her lips, but it seemed as if the
rest of her face was overshadowed with sadness.</p>

<p>I offered her my arm, which she took.</p>

<p>“What would you like to do?” I asked her. “Would
you rather stay here, or take a stroll in the wood?”</p>

<p>“Take me under the shadow of yon great trees, M.
Réné. In my little chamber at Varennes I stifle for want
of air.”</p>

<p>“It is singular, Mdlle. Sophie, that I always believed
that you preferred the town to the country.”</p>

<p>“I prefer nothing. I live, that is all.”</p>

<p>She heaved a sigh.</p>

<p>The conversation fell.</p>

<p>I threw a side glance at Sophie. She appeared fatigued
and in pain.</p>

<p>“You look pale,” said I; “and although you do not prefer
the country to the town, I fancy it does you more good.”</p>

<p>She shrugged her shoulders, by way of reply.</p>

<p>“Perhaps,” said she.</p>

<p>I turned towards my uncle’s cottage, all covered with ivy
and creepers, surrounded by flowers and shadowed by the
branches of chestnuts and beech-trees.</p>

<p>It was beautiful, seen half in light and half in shadow.
A cat was sleeping comfortably on the window-sill; two
dogs were playing in front of the door; and a black-headed
linnet was singing in its cage.</p>

<p>It was a beautiful picture of contented country life.</p>

<p>“Look, Mdlle. Sophie,” said I drawing her attention to
the scene. “Would a little place like that, with a man
who had the honor of being beloved by you, suffice for
your ambition?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76"></a>[76]</span></p>

<p>“Who told you that I had ambition, Réné?”</p>

<p>“I ask you, do you think that you could be happy under
those circumstances?”</p>

<p>She looked at me.</p>

<p>“You see, then, that I am now miserable?”</p>

<p>“You told me so in a letter, when I was staying at
Varennes, eight months ago.”</p>

<p>“And have you not forgotten what I wrote to you so long
as eight months ago?”</p>

<p>I drew a little portfolio from my pocket, and out of it I
took a little scrap of paper, on which was written, in her
hand—</p>

<p>“I have no friend, Réné; will you be one? I am very
unhappy.”</p>

<p>“If the paper is a little crumpled,” said I, “it is because
a day has never passed without my reading it.”</p>

<p>“Then how is it that I have never seen you since that
morning, Réné?”</p>

<p>“For what purpose? Since you wrote to me you cannot
have doubted me.”</p>

<p>“You have a good heart, Réné, and I did not wish to see
you to get that opinion from you.”</p>

<p>“That is well. If you had had need of me, you had but
to write, and I should have been with you in a moment.
At first, day after day, I hoped for a letter. Oh, if I had
received one!—had it been only the one word ‘Come!’—with
what joy would I have flown to your side! But such
happiness was not for me. Days, weeks, months passed
away, and I remained alone with my sorrow, without ever
being called away to offer you a consolation.”</p>

<p>She looked at me with an expression of affectionate
tenderness.</p>

<p>“Ah, Réné, I should have liked to have seen you; but
not hearing from you, I thought that you had forgotten
me.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Mdlle. Sophie!” I cried; “I am not sufficiently
happy or unhappy for that.”</p>

<p>“In truth, my dear Réné,” said she, trying to smile,
“you have quite the air of a hero of romance.”</p>

<p>“As I have never read a romance, I scarcely know what
that is.”</p>

<p>“A hero of romance, Réné,” said Sophie, smiling at the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77"></a>[77]</span>
experimental lesson in literature she was trying to give me,
“is a man who loves without hope.”</p>

<p>“That is good. Then am I a hero of romance. By the
bye, what are these heroes supposed to do?”</p>

<p>“Everything impossible, in order to touch the heart of
the woman they vainly love.”</p>

<p>“Then I am ready to do so; but, if commanded by you,
I should know not impossibility.”</p>

<p>“Do not put your life in danger, Réné,” said Sophie.
“Sighing for that would not benefit either of us.”</p>

<p>Now it was her turn to stop, and, having turned the
corner of the road, she pointed out to me my uncle’s house
under a different aspect, but still how beautiful!</p>

<p>“You just now asked me, Réné, if that house, in company
with a man whom I loved, would not satisfy my ambition?
Well, Réné, in my turn, I adjure you, in the name
of that friendship that I have avowed towards you, wish for
nothing more than that calm and peaceful existence that
Providence has placed in your way. Follow the example
of your uncle, who, for eighty years, has lived in peace
with himself and with all mankind, without seeking to
better his condition, and without ever wishing for a
larger house, or a greater extent of land. In fact, this
forest before us—is it not his? Do not its trees give
him shelter? Do not the birds which inhabit it sing
for his gratification, and do not the animals that make
it their home serve for his food? In name, it belongs to
the King; but, in reality, it is his. Réné, find a woman
who loves you; that, I am sure, will not be difficult. My
father tells me that you are one of the best carpenters that
he knows. Ask the consent of your uncle—he will not
refuse it; and live, as he has done, on the little spot where
the happiest years of your life have passed away.”</p>

<p>In my turn, I shook my head.</p>

<p>“You will not?” said Sophie. “What, then, do you
intend to do?”</p>

<p>“Mademoiselle Sophie,” said I, “I purpose being a
man.”</p>

<p>“Has not your uncle been also a man, Réné?”</p>

<p>“Yes; but a man useless to his country. The times in
which he lived, and the times in which we live, are different.
The tranquillity which existed in his generation is
not permitted in this.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78"></a>[78]</span></p>

<p>“You are ambitious, Réné?” asked Sophie.</p>

<p>“It is not ambition, mademoiselle; it is obedience to the
designs of heaven. There are times when every man, great
or small, carries his mission in himself. What, then? He
must keep that mission till it is fulfilled. Who knows but
that even I, insignificant as I am, have one? You have
already drawn me from the crowd of my equals, because
you condescended to take my arm. It was not all that I
could have wished. Oh, Sophie, I ask you, here, under the
shelter of these great trees, the most sacred temple that I
know of, will you promise to be mine? Will you give me
all the love that you can, and the happiest day of my life
will be that on which I can prove my devotion to you!
Oh, Sophie, give me hope!”</p>

<p>“I believe you, Réné; in fact, from the first moment I saw
you, I never doubted you. Ah! why were you not always
with me, to support me with your arm when I stumbled,
and with your heart when I doubted? I have called on
you many times, Réné.”</p>

<p>“Can this be true, Mademoiselle Sophie?” cried I, filled
with joy.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said she, “but do not misunderstand me. I do
not love you. I never shall love you, Réné,” continued
she, looking me full in the face. “I feel instinctively that
I have need of your friendship. Why I should implore it,
how it can be useful to me, I know not; but still I feel
sure I shall have recourse to it some day; and if you are
away from me, Réné, on that day, whose help shall I implore?
If you are near to me, I can rely on you; can I
not? Again I say to you, as I wrote once before, I am
truly unhappy.”</p>

<p>She took her arm from mine, hid her face in her hand,
and I could see by the heaving of her bosom that she was
weeping.</p>

<p>“Mademoiselle Sophie!” said I.</p>

<p>“Leave me, my friend—leave me. I do not like to weep
before you, and I feel that I must weep.”</p>

<p>And, with one hand, she made me a sign to go.</p>

<p>I obeyed.</p>

<p>She sat down by the side of a little brook, which fell
into the Brésme, and taking off her hat, which she placed
by her side, began to pluck flowers, and throw them into
the water.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79"></a>[79]</span></p>

<p>Sixty years have passed since that day, and I fancy that
I can still see the poor child with her golden hair floating
in the breeze, the tears coursing down her cheeks, throwing
the flowers into the current of the Brésme, which would
carry them to the Aisne, the Aisne to the Oise, the Oise to
the Seine, and the Seine to the sea.</p>

<p>After about an hour had passed, she got up silently, came
towards me, and smilingly took my arm.</p>

<p>We retraced our steps to my uncle’s house.</p>

<p>We had scarcely arrived, when we heard the sound of
wheels. It was Father Gerbaut’s carriage.</p>

<p>Sophie, who had not spoken one word all the way home,
seized my hand.</p>

<p>“Réné,” she said, “do not forget that you have given me
your word; I trust you.”</p>

<p>“Mademoiselle Sophie,” said I, pressing her hand to my
heart, “one call alone can be stronger than yours—that of
my country.”</p>

<p>M. Gerbaut stayed about an hour to rest his horse, and
then, with Sophie, mounted into his vehicle.</p>

<p>The poor girl waved her hand. Father Gerbaut cried
“Farewell!” and the carriage disappeared behind a clump
of trees, which hid the road to Meuvilly.</p>

<p>I returned to where Sophie had been sitting down; I
picked up the flowers she had let fall, and placed them in
my little portfolio, together with the letter which she had
written to me at Varennes, and in which she had poured
forth all her soul.</p>

<span class="fs70">THE PEOPLE IN COUNCIL.</span></h2>


<p>On the morrow, the ninth of July, ’90, we were <i lang="fr">en route</i>
at daybreak, drums beating in front of us, to assist in the
celebration of the grand fête of the general federation.</p>

<p>Father Descharmes embraced me, with an expression of
sorrow which wounded me to the heart.</p>

<p>“Perhaps you youngsters are in the right,” said he, “and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80"></a>[80]</span>
we old men are in the wrong. But what will you, my child.
One cannot give up in two days the creed of sixty years.”</p>

<p>“I know not what may come of all this, but I hope that
my eyes will be closed in death before it does come.”</p>

<p>“But uncle,” said I, “although it would be a great treat
to me to go to Paris and see the fête, still, if you wish it, I
will not go.”</p>

<p>“No, my boy, go; and heaven grant that I may live to
see your return, and that we may meet again in this
world.”</p>

<p>I embraced him as I wept, for I loved him dearly.</p>

<p>Had he not fed and clothed me and brought me up, and
watched the infant become, under his roof a man?</p>

<p>“Bring my arm-chair to the door,” said he; “I do not
wish to lose the last glimpse of the setting sun.”</p>

<p>I obeyed. Leaning on my shoulder he reached the door,
and sitting down in the chair, took my hand, and kissed me,
saying “Go!”</p>

<p>I departed, returning in time to see this good old servitor
of royalty die. With kingcraft he suffered, and with
its death he died.</p>

<p>When I lost sight of him, it seemed as if I had left him
for ever, and I felt half inclined to return at once, never to
leave him; but the temptation of seeing Paris was too
much for me, and in another moment we were in sight of
the houses of Islettes.</p>

<p>A surprise awaited me there.</p>

<p>The inhabitants, not wishing to be separated from their
Curé, had put him into a little carriage drawn by a horse,
and the good priest, his eyes overflowing with tears, was
bidding farewell to Mademoiselle Marguerite, who wept on
the steps in front of the door of the Presbytery.</p>

<p>In those days, a journey of forty leagues was no small
matter, and the poor girl believed that the good Abbé Fortin
had departed for ever.</p>

<p>We continued our route, the drums beating, and the carriage
rolling ahead of us. Some of our party pressed on in
front, to form an escort of honor for the worthy priest.</p>

<p>We found M. Drouet awaiting us at the head of the
deputation, on the Place of St. Menehould.</p>

<p>Amongst the deputation, was an old soldier of the Seven
Years War, who had served under Marshal Saxe, and who<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81"></a>[81]</span>
was present at the battle of Fontenoy; and a sailor, who
was in active service at the time of the birth of the Bailli
de Suffren. Both, living ruins of an ancient regime,
wished to witness the dawn of a new era.</p>

<p>M. Drouet had placed a carriage at their service, but
they would not use it. It therefore proceeded empty in the
midst of the <i lang="fr">cortêge</i>, in the front rank of which the two
veterans marched with heads erect—a benediction, as it
were, bestowed by the dead era on the age which was just
about to dawn.</p>

<p>All the high roads of France were filled with processions
like ours, all hastening to one great focus—Paris.</p>

<p>Never since the Crusade had so great a number, of
their own will, bent their steps in one direction.</p>

<p>All along the road, deputations came to greet the travellers.</p>

<p>They offered hospitality to the old men and priests. It
was impossible to provide for all, so the main body bivouacked
in the open air.</p>

<p>Great fires were lighted, at which every one prepared his
simple meal. There was no lack of wine in a country
which particularly cultivated grapes.</p>

<p>On the morrow, at daybreak, all started at beat of drum.
When the noise of the drum ceased, all joined in the chorus
of the <i lang="fr">Ça ira</i> of ’90, which has nothing in common with
the menacing and bloodthirsty <i lang="fr">Ça ira</i> of ’93.</p>

<p>This song kept up the energies of those men on the
march, who were toiling along under a hot July sun, to the
end of the journey. It supported those laborers who were
making the arena, so to speak, where great deeds were to
be done.</p>

<p>We have said that it was with an unwilling heart that
the Assembly decreed the federation—that it was with an
unwilling heart that the city had sent its workmen to the
<span lang="fr">Champ de Mars</span>, to prepare for that great and solemn
reunion. The time approached—the work did not proceed.
What happened?</p>

<p>All Paris rose, and proceeded to the <span lang="fr">Champ de Mars</span>
carrying various implements of labor—one a pickaxe
another a shovel, and so on.</p>

<p>And not only did the people—not only did the <i lang="fr">bourgeoisie</i>
do this, but old men and children, lords and laborers, ladies<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82"></a>[82]</span>
of rank and women of shame, actors and actresses, priests
and soldiers,—all joined in the work, which did not even
close when night fell like a shroud over the city of Paris.</p>

<p>The invalids, who could not work on account of their
being maimed, held the torches, to lighten them at their
labors.</p>

<p>Begun in the morning of the 9th of July, this stupendous
work was completed in the night of the 13th, two
hours before sunrise.</p>

<p>We arrived on the 12th, in the evening.</p>

<p>Paris was crowded; but, strange to say, the hotel
keepers and letters of lodgings, instead of raising their
prices, lowered them considerably. This spoke well for the
disposition of Paris towards us.</p>

<p>Truly this was not the federation of France, but the fraternal
greeting of the world.</p>

<p>A Prussian Baron—Jean Baptiste de Clootz, better
known by the name of Anacharsis—presented himself
before the National Assembly with twenty men of different
nations—Russians, Poles, men of the north, men of
the west, men of the east, and men of the south,—all
habited in the costume of their country. He came to ask
permission for them to appear at the federation of the
<span lang="fr">Champ de Mars</span>, as they wished to represent the federation
of the world.</p>

<p>Later on, this same Anacharsis Clootz wished to give
twelve thousand francs, to make war against royalty.</p>

<p>One may imagine my astonishment on finding myself in
Paris, on the Boulevards, gazing at the ruins of the Bastille.</p>

<p>Drouet pointed it out to me, afterwards, the patriotic workmen
on the <span lang="fr">Champ de Mars</span>. I rushed to join them; and,
seizing a spade, was speedily hard at work.</p>

<p>My fellow-workman appeared to be an artizan of about
fifty years of age. He gave orders to a boy about my age,
who was close at hand.</p>

<p>On seeing the ardor with which I worked, he asked me
who I was, and whence I came.</p>

<p>I told him that my name was Réné Besson; that I came
from the new department of the Meuse; and that I was
apprenticed to a carpenter, by trade.</p>

<p>When he heard this, he held out his hand, a smile illuminating
his austere visage.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83"></a>[83]</span></p>

<p>“Take that, boy,” said he. “If you are an apprentice,
I am a master; and here are two lads, about your age, who
live with me, to learn their trade. If you have nothing
better to do, come and sup with me to-night—you shall be
made welcome.”</p>

<p>I shook hands with him, and accepted his kind offer.
The French, at the dawn of the Revolution, were a nation
of brothers.</p>

<p>As the clock struck five, we threw down our tools, gave
ourselves a wash in the Seine; after which we crossed over
to the other side of the river, and entered the Rue St.
Honoré.</p>

<p>The master and I had walked side by side all the way,
the two apprentices following behind.</p>

<p>He asked me some questions about our department, what
political opinions we had, and whether I knew any one in
Paris.</p>

<p>I answered all his questions with becoming modesty.</p>

<p>My companion stopped at the commencement of the Rue
St. Honoré, on the left-hand side, opposite a church, which
I discovered later on to be the Church of Assumption.</p>

<p>“We have arrived,” said he; “I will go first, to show
you the way.”</p>

<p>He passed down a passage, at the extremity of which I
perceived a light.</p>

<p>I involuntarily raised my head, and read on the façade
of the house these three words:</p>

<p class="center">
“<span class="smcap">Duplay</span>, Master Carpenter.”<br>
</p>

<p>I entered—the apprentices followed me.</p>


<div class="chapter"></div>
<figure class="figcenter illowe10">

</figure>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XIV">CHAPTER XIV.<br>
<span class="fs70">MY NEW PARISIAN FRIENDS.</span></h2>


<p>The carpenter, Duplay, in contact with whom fortune had
brought me, had, at that period—that is to say, on the 12th
of July, 1790,—the celebrity of having given shelter to a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84"></a>[84]</span>
notorious revolutionist, which celebrity afterwards was attached
to his name, his family, and his house.</p>

<p>He was a good patriot, and attended constantly at the
Jacobin Club which was held in the neighborhood, and
where almost all his evenings were passed, applauding the
speeches of a little advocate of Arras, who, though ridiculed
in the National Assembly, was appreciated in the Rue St.
Honoré. The name of this little advocate was Robespierre.</p>

<p>When we arrived, we found the table laid for supper,
through the forethought of his two daughters, Estelle and
Cornelie. Their old grandmother was seated in an arm-chair,
and Madame Duplay was in the kitchen, devoting all
her attention to the forthcoming meal.</p>

<p>I was introduced to the two young ladies, both very
charming girls. Estelle was a blonde, with beautiful blue
eyes, and a figure wonderfully symmetrical, and flexible as
a reed.</p>

<p>Cornelie was a brunette, with eyes black as sloes, and a
stately and majestic contour.</p>

<p>Estelle dropped her eyes, as she curtseyed.</p>

<p>Cornelie smiled, and looked me full in the face.</p>

<p>Neither, however, paid much attention to me after the
first salutation. I was younger than the youngest of them—that
is to say, in their eyes, almost a child.</p>

<p>As to the apprentices, one appeared to be about eighteen,
and the other a month or two older than I.</p>

<p>The elder was called Jacques Dinant. I don’t know
what has since become of him. The other was Félicién
Herda, afterwards a celebrity in the Revolution.</p>

<p>This latter was a young man—fair, of a light complexion—a
regular child of Paris—irritable, and as nervous as a
woman. The nickname which his comrades gave him, as
his irritability was always dragging him into controversy,
and as he used always to say “No” to every theory, was
“Citizen Veto.”</p>

<p>Need I say that the veto was the prerogative of the King,
and that it was through his wrong use of this privilege on
two occasions that he alienated his people.</p>

<p>Madame Duplay appeared from the kitchen, with the
first course. I was presented to her; but she paid even
less attention to me than her two daughters had done.</p>

<p>She was about thirty-eight or forty years of age, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85"></a>[85]</span>
must, at one time, have been beautiful, but with those
coarse and too matured charms common to the lower orders
of the people.</p>

<p>She shared all the patriotic opinions of her husband, and
was, like him, an ardent admirer of Robespierre.</p>

<p>There was a discussion during supper concerning the
relative merits of the Jacobin leaders, in which the apprentices
took part as equals of their master.</p>

<p>I fancied, somehow, that Félicién Herda regarded me
with an evil eye. As the stranger, I had the seat of honor
next to Mademoiselle Cornelie; and I think he must have
looked upon it as an encroachment on his privileges.</p>

<p>Although well read in antiquity, I was profoundly ignorant
of modern politics, and this gained me the pity of
M. Duplay.</p>

<p>I knew the name of the famous Club of Jacobins, where
Monsieur passed his patriotic evenings, but of all else I was
ignorant.</p>

<p>From that bed of aristocratic Jacobins of ’89, one could
not foretell the springing up of the terrible and popular
Jacobins of ’93.</p>

<p>Robespierre alone appeared, but he began to assume that
pale and impassible visage which was never forgotten, if
once seen.</p>

<p>Duplay promised to take me to the Jacobins, and to show
me him who was known among them by the title of an
“honest man.”</p>

<p>Robespierre had, as yet, but on two occasions spoken;
and he had obtained the name of the “Timon of public
affairs.”</p>

<p>I know not if it was the view of Robespierre, whom
I saw that night for the first time, that engraved the words
on my mind, but I know this—that, in sixty years, I have
not forgotten one word of his biography, or one lineament
of his face.</p>

<p>I feel that I could draw his portrait now, as life-like as
when he appeared first to me, on the platform, preparing to
address us; and, from that time to the end, I was his most
devoted admirer.</p>

<p>Robespierre was born in 1758, in that old, sombre, ecclesiastical
and judicial town of Arras, capital of Artois, a province
of France only 150 years, and where may yet be seen
the ruins of the immense palace of its King-Bishop.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86"></a>[86]</span></p>

<p>His father, an advocate of the council of the province,
lived in <span lang="fr">Rue de Rapporteur</span>. The young Maximilian was
born there, that name being given him in honor of the last
conqueror of the city.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding his hard work, the advocate was poor;
but a wife, older than himself, helped to alleviate their poverty.
She died. He thought the burden too heavy to bear
alone, so, one morning, he decamped, and was no more seen
in Arras.</p>

<p>They spoke of suicide, but nothing was proved.</p>

<p>The house was shut up, the four children abandoned. The
eldest, Maximilian, was eleven; after him, came his brother,
whom they called “young Robespierre;” after him, two
sisters, one of whom, called Charlotte de Robespierre, has
left some rare and curious memoirs. The other sister died
three or four years after the disappearance of her father.</p>

<p>What with the death of his mother, and the absence of
his father, there was enough to render the boy serious and
unhappy. The friends who assisted the family asked the
powerful Abbé of St. Vaast, who possessed a third of the
town, and who had the disposal of many bursarships at the
college of Louis-le-Grand, to give one to young Maximilian.
The charitable Abbé complied with their desire.</p>

<p>He started alone for Paris, with a letter of recommendation
to a prebendary, who died almost at the same time as
the young bursar entered the college.</p>

<p>It was in that ancient building that the young pupil
grew pale, sickly, and envenomed, like a flower deprived
of the sun; away from home, away from his friends, separated
from all who loved him, and from all who could have
brought a glow to his cheeks, or imparted happiness to his
withered soul.</p>

<p>It was there that he met Camille Desmoulins, an ecclesiastical
bursar like himself, and Danton, a paying pupil.</p>

<p>The sole friendship of his boyhood was formed with
these two. How lightly that friendship weighed in the
balance we know, when he believed that the moment had
come to sacrifice it on the shrine of his country.</p>

<p>Two things militated against the firm continuance of
this friendship; the one, the gaiety of Camille Desmoulins;
and the other, the immorality of Danton, who paid
no attention to the reproaches of his fellow-student.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87"></a>[87]</span></p>

<p>Robespierre paid for his bursarship with laurel crowns.
He left with the reputation of being a sound scholar—a
reputation which gained him few friends and little honor.
He afterwards studied with a procureur, entitled himself
to practise, and returned to Arras a middling lawyer, but
a stern politician, and having learnt to smile with the lips
while the heart was filled with gall.</p>

<p>His younger brother took his place at college, while
Maximilian, through the kindness of the Abbé de St.
Vaast, was nominated a member of the criminal tribunal.</p>

<p>One of the first cases that he had to judge was that of
an assassin. The crime was not only patent, but avowed.
It fell to Robespierre to pronounce sentence of death.</p>

<p>The next day he sent in his resignation, not wishing to
be put to a like test again.</p>

<p>That is how it was that he became an advocate. His
philanthropy made him the defender, in place of the condemner
of men. Duplay pretended to know, from certain
sources, that Robespierre had never undertaken to defend a
cause that was not just; but even were it just, he had to
uphold it against all. He examined the cause of the peasants
who brought a complaint against the Bishop of Arras,
found it just, pleaded against his benefactor, and gained the
day.</p>

<p>This rectitude, although it had no material influence on
his fortunes, increased greatly his reputation. The province
sent him to the Etats Généraux, where he had for his
adversaries all the nobility and clergy of his native State.</p>

<p>For adversaries—we say too much. The priest and
nobles thought too little of him to regard him in such a
light.</p>

<p>This contempt, which had followed Maximilian to college,
pursued him with greater violence now that he had attained
a seat in the National Assembly.</p>

<p>He was poor and they knew it. They ridiculed his
poverty; he thought it an honor. Having nothing, receiving
nothing, but his salary as a member of the Assembly,
a third of which went to his sister, he still lived. When
the Assembly put on mourning for the death of Franklin,
Robespierre, too poor to purchase a suit of black, borrowed
a coat for four francs, which, being too long for him, excited,
throughout the time of mourning, the irrepressible mirth of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88"></a>[88]</span>
the Assembly. The only consolation left him among all
this ridicule was, that no one doubted his honesty.</p>

<p>“Had I not confidence,” said he, in one of his speeches,
“I should be one of the most wretched men in the world.”</p>

<p>Yet, notwithstanding this, the man was not popular.
Some few, indeed, through a species of instinct, saw that
he was capable of great things, and among these were
Duplay, his wife, and his two daughters.</p>

<p>All these details were given me during supper with the
persistence of conviction. It was, therefore, with the liveliest
satisfaction that I hailed M. Duplay’s offer to take me
to the Jacobins’ Club, and looked forward with curiosity to
see him whom they called <em>honest</em>, and afterwards stamped
<em>incorruptible</em>.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XV">CHAPTER XV.<br>
<span class="fs70">I GO TO THE JACOBINS’ CLUB.</span></h2>


<p>At nine o’clock, we left the house, and walked up the
Rue St. Honoré towards the Palais Royal.</p>

<p>A current of people pointed the way, stopping at the
little door of the Jacobin convent, which exists to this day.</p>

<p>I knew not that this was the place where the aristocratic
and literary assembly held their meetings until told so by
Duplay.</p>

<p>The entry was as difficult as that of a sanctuary. By
special favor, as chief carpenter to the Duke of Orleans,
Duplay had a card of admission.</p>

<p>At the door, Cornelie, Estelle, and the two apprentices
left us, plunging down a staircase veritably built in the
thickness of the wall.</p>

<p>I asked M. Duplay where they were going. He told me
that there was, under the church, a smaller hall—a sort of
crypt—where the workmen and their wives held a club—the
workmen attending in the day, their wives at night.
They there explained to each other the constitution.</p>

<p>Two ushers kept guard on each side of the door.</p>

<p>One, small and fat, with a bass voice, was the famous<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89"></a>[89]</span>
singer, Lais, whom the <i lang="fr">habitués</i> of the Opera applauded
up to 1825.</p>

<p>The other, a handsome young man with wavy hair,
undisfigured by powder, and a generally aristocratic air,
was a pupil of Madame de Genlis, the son of the Duke of
Orleans, the Duke of Chartres, the conqueror of Jemappes,
and the future King of France.</p>

<p>By his side was his young brother, the Duke of Montpensier,
for whom, with great trouble, he had obtained
admittance, notwithstanding his extreme youth.</p>

<p>On entering, at sight of the orator, who occupied the
tribune, I cried out, “Ah! there is M. Robespierre.”</p>

<p>In fact, after the portrait M. Duplay had given me, it
was impossible not to recognize him. The impression he
produced upon me was profound.</p>

<p>Yes, it was he, although his face had not yet assumed
the grim and fantastic appearance that it did later on.
There he was, with that primly-brushed olive-colored coat,
and that waistcoat of snowy whiteness, with his hair powdered,
and thrown back from his brow, the skin of which,
in its hideous wrinkles, reminded one of the parchment on
a death’s head.</p>

<p>It was that wrinkled face, sullen and acute; that eye,
with its tawny yellow pupil, which shot between its
retracted lids a glance replete with malice, that seemed to
wound aught it fell upon; it was that mouth, broad and
stern, with its compressed lips; it was that voice, harsh in
all its notes, and resembling the laugh of a hyena, or the
scream of a jackal; it was the whole figure of the man,
quivering with a nervous spasm, which caused his fingers
to be continually drumming on the ledge of the rostrum,
like a pianist on the keys of a spinnet; it was, in short,
the revolution incarnate with his implacable good faith, his
freshness of blood, his mind determined, bloodthirsty, and
cruel.</p>

<p>As we entered, he finished his speech, and descended
amid shouts of applause.</p>

<p>I followed him with my eyes, in spite of myself, into the
midst of the crowd, through which, small and thin as he
was, he easily passed. Not a hand but was stretched out to
grasp his, not a voice that did not address him. One man,
dressed in black, stopped him, as he passed the desk, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90"></a>[90]</span>
said one word to him. He started, his face expressed
hatred and disgust, and he passed on without replying.</p>

<p>“Who was that sombre-looking man who spoke to
M. de Robespierre?” said I, to M. Duplay.</p>

<p>He smiled.</p>

<p>“It is a customer of mine, to whose intervention with
the Duke of Orleans I owe the right of coming here. His
name is M. de Laclos, and he has written a very bad
book.”</p>

<p>“What book?” asked I.</p>

<p>“‘Les Liaisons Dangereuses.’”</p>

<p>“Well, what then? Speak lower.”</p>

<p>“He is the man of the Duke of Orleans; he it was who,
in the <span lang="fr">Cour des Fontaines</span>, under the shadow of the Palais
Royal, published <cite lang="fr">Le Journal des Amis de la Constitution</cite>.
Robespierre hates him on account of his fame, but he is all-powerful
here. It is he who disposes of the purse of the
Prince. Hush! M. de Sillery, the husband of Madame
de Genlis, is listening to us.”</p>

<p>All this was Hebrew to me. I asked who M. de Sillery
and Madame de Genlis were.</p>

<p>“Ah! of course,” said he; “I forgot that you had only
just arrived in Paris, from the depths of some impenetrable
forest, and of course know not the names of those who are
around us.”</p>

<p>“I fancy that I know the name of M. de Sillery. If I
do not deceive myself, he has been sent by the nobility of
Champagne.”</p>

<p>“Good, my boy, good!”</p>

<p>“But it is the man,” continued I, “that I do not know.”</p>

<p>“Well, I will tell you all about the man. We begin to
know names, as well as men. Charles Alexis Brulart is a
marquis, like Lafayette, but having, like him, renounced
his title, on the night of the 4th of August, he calls himself
Sillery, as I call myself Duplay. As to his courage, it
cannot be doubted. At twenty years of age, he assisted in
the campaign of the Indies, and gained his rank at the
point of the sword.”</p>

<p>“What rank did he gain?” asked I.</p>

<p>“Captain in the navy.”</p>

<p>“But he wears the uniform of a colonel of grenadiers.”</p>

<p>“Yes. He has left the navy for the army; he is the accredited<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91"></a>[91]</span>
agent of the Duke of Orleans. In his youth, he
was called Comte de Genlis; that, as I have told you, is the
name of his wife. She has acquired a double, and doubtful,
celebrity, as the friend of the Duke of Orleans, whose
children she has educated, and as a writer, in which occupation
she is at present engaged.”</p>

<p>“But what does M. de Sillery say to all this?” asked I.</p>

<p>Duplay lifted his brows.</p>

<p>“No wonder M. Robespierre is not his friend!”</p>

<p>“One cannot be friendly with Robespierre and the Duke
of Orleans at the same time,” said Duplay, shaking his
head. “But patience!” All eyes are turned towards a
man who enters. One felt, at first sight, without knowing
him, that he was some great personage.</p>

<p>An immense forest of hair; a head resembling, for size
and marked outline, a lion’s or a bull’s, indicated a ruler of
the multitude. I had not time to ask Duplay who he was,
for every mouth murmured the word “Mirabeau!—Mirabeau!”</p>

<p>“Ah!” cried Duplay; “there is the hurricane that
brings us news. Draw near to him, that you may say,
when you return home, that you have not only seen and
heard Mirabeau, but that you have touched him.”</p>

<p>We approached; but, of a truth, it was necessary to
approach in order to hear.</p>

<p>All the audience collected round him.</p>

<p>I looked for M. de Robespierre, to see if he pressed round
like the others.</p>

<p>He was isolated, alone, leaning against the rostrum,
with a disdainful air, watching the men following the idol
of popularity, like a shower of leaves after an autumn
storm.</p>

<p>He knew that the crowd never drew near him, incorruptible;
but it rushed after Mirabeau, the corrupted; and, at
the same time, he both envied and blamed him.</p>

<p>The debate of the National Assembly had been stormy.
There were a few nobles there, who witnessed, with profound
grief, that union of all the parties of France.</p>

<p>Mirabeau had been insulted in the rostrum. A gentleman,
M. Dambly, had threatened him with his walking-stick.
Mirabeau stopped his speech, drew his tablets from his pocket,
and demanded M. Dambly’s address.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92"></a>[92]</span></p>

<p>He cried it out from one end of the hall to the other.</p>

<p>“Very good!” said Mirabeau; “you are the one hundred
and fiftieth person who has insulted me, and with whom I
will fight when I have the time. Until your turn has come,
hold your peace. I ask the President to make you pass
your word to that effect.”</p>

<p>Mirabeau related the story with incredible irony. All
laughed—all said he was in the right.</p>

<p>“And Lameth?” asked several members.</p>

<p>“Which?—Alexander or Charles?”</p>

<p>“Charles.”</p>

<p>“Oh, that is another matter! After practising with the
rapier for two days, he could not decide upon anything; and,
at the close of the Assembly, M. de Castrie cried out that
he was a coward. They went out, and fought, and Lameth
received a rapier thrust in his arm.”</p>

<p>“Is it true that the sword was poisoned?” asked one
voice.</p>

<p>“I know not that; but I do know that they are preparing
to raze M. de Castrie’s house to the ground.”</p>

<p>This news was greeted with a shout of laughter.</p>

<p>At this moment, an eager voice was heard, urging the
debate. Robespierre was on the forum.</p>

<p>He began to speak in the midst of the noise. As far as
I could judge, he spoke for union; but the noise and excitement
were so great, that it was almost impossible to hear
what he said.</p>

<p>But, accustomed to noise and interruptions, Robespierre
continued, with that indefatigable perseverance, and that
indomitable stubbornness which made his greatness, and,
finally, his triumph.</p>

<p>Robespierre had spoken for ten minutes, and would, probably,
have eventually succeeded in gaining silence, had
not all attention been distracted from him by another
arrival.</p>

<p>This was one of the heroes of the duel which Mirabeau
had spoken of—Charles Lameth. He carried his right arm
in a sling; but, with that exception, looked and walked
wonderfully well.</p>

<p>All crowded round him, as they had done round Mirabeau,
but with a different sentiment.</p>

<p>Charles Lameth was the friend of all the intelligent<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93"></a>[93]</span>
young men who composed the majority of the Jacobin
Club.</p>

<p>Duplay pointed out to me, successively, Laharpe; the
poet, Chénier; the painter, David; the tragedian, Talma;
Audrien, Ledaine, Larive, Vernet, Chamfort—all men of
intellect. Then I returned to the rostrum. Completely
abandoned, Robespierre had descended, after throwing upon
that gathering of life, hope, and activity, a glance that
seemed to presage evil to come.</p>

<p>No one knew that he had ascended the rostrum; all
were equally ignorant of his descent. Perhaps I was the
only one who noticed the look of malignant hatred with
which he regarded that knot of literary and scientific men,
who had utterly disregarded—whether wilfully or not—himself
and his discourse.</p>

<p>Presently, Duplay took my arm, and led me out of the
hall.</p>

<p>“Return in a year,” he said, “and your eyes will be
opened. There will be fewer plumes, fewer epaulets, less
embroidery, but more men.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XVI">CHAPTER XVI.<br>
<span class="fs70">PARIS BEFORE THE REVOLUTION.</span></h2>


<p>I wished to go to the Rue Grange Batélière, where
M. Drouet lived, and where he had appointed a rendezvous
at the “<span lang="fr">Hotel des Postes</span>;” but M. Duplay insisting that
I should partake of the hospitality of a bed, as I had
already done of the table, I felt that I could not well refuse.</p>

<p>It was arranged that I should share Félicién’s room, in
which they made me up a bed. On the morrow, at daybreak,
I should be at liberty to seek out M. Drouet, after my
hair had been arranged according to the new fashion.</p>

<p>As that was an operation which must be performed
sooner or later, on entering the house I seized upon a pair of
scissors, handed them to Mademoiselle Cornelie, and asked
her to perform on me the same feat that Delilah performed
on Samson—viz., to cut off my flowing locks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94"></a>[94]</span></p>

<p>The sacrifice was consummated amid the laughter of the
two girls.</p>

<p>One person alone did not join in the merriment thus
provoked, and that person was he whose room I was going
to share for the night. It was evident to me that he loved
Cornelie, and was jealous of me—absurd idea; but the first
stage of jealousy is absurdity.</p>

<p>The operation was over; they led me to a mirror to see
if I were satisfied with the change worked in my personal
appearance. At the first glance I felt inclined to laugh
myself; I was more than clipped—I was almost shorn.</p>

<p>My ridiculous appearance restored Félicién to good humor
with Mademoiselle Cornelie; and, as the servant appeared
to announce that the room was prepared, he asked me to
follow him, and he would show the way.</p>

<p>The first things that I remarked on entering the room
were a pair of fencing foils, and a couple of masks to protect
the face. I thought these rather strange ornaments for
the bed-chamber of an apprenticed carpenter.</p>

<p>“Do you know what those are for?” asked he with a
braggart air.</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied I.</p>

<p>“Can you use them?”</p>

<p>“Not particularly well at present; but another month
or two in the Salle d’Armes will improve me, I hope.”</p>

<p>“To-morrow,” said he, “if you like, we will have a
bout.”</p>

<p>“I am not sure whether I shall be able to. I fear that
M. Drouet will be anxious about me.”</p>

<p>“Will you have a bout now?” said he.</p>

<p>“Certainly,” I replied, “if you wish it; but we have
plenty of time before us. I shall not leave Paris without
returning to thank M. Duplay, and then we shall have a
better opportunity.”</p>

<p>These evasive answers made Félicién think that I was
not particularly anxious to cross foils with him; so he commenced
a recital of his prowess and so, kindly lulled me to
sleep.</p>

<p>I awoke, as usual, at daybreak, and slipping quietly out
of bed, I dressed myself with as little noise as possible,
so as not to awaken Félicién, and when ready, I left the
room, and descended into the court.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95"></a>[95]</span></p>

<p>All of M. Duplay’s household were asleep, but the door
was left open, so that I did not waste an instant.</p>

<p>The clock of the Church of Assumption sounded the
half-after four o’clock as I left the house. I was utterly
incapable of finding my way about Paris, in which I had
arrived only the evening before; but the solemnity to be
observed on the morrow had early drawn crowds abroad, so
the streets were pretty full notwithstanding the untimely
hour.</p>

<p>I asked my nearest route; they pointed out to me the
Boulevards. Arrived there, I had only to follow that by
no means despicable portion of my body, my nose, and, in
a very short time, I discovered the Rue Grange Batélière.
Ten minutes after, I entered the “<span lang="fr">Hotel des Postes</span>,” and
discovered, to my great joy, that M. Drouet was within.</p>

<p>I rushed to his chamber, and opened the door gently.
He was not only awake, but on his feet.</p>

<p>“Ah! there you are!” said he, after having looked at
me for an instant without having recognised me, on account
of the disappearance of my hair. “Where have you been,
you vagabond? I have been in a nice state of mind, I can
assure you. It appears that you have been taken in a trap,
like a fox, and been compelled to leave your tail behind
you.”</p>

<p>“But you also have acquiesced in the mode.”</p>

<p>“Yes; but not with the same enthusiasm as you. You
have been foolish enough to cross the Pont Neuf, my boy.”</p>

<p>Not knowing what happened on the Pont Neuf, I could
not appreciate M. Drouet’s pleasantry.</p>

<p>I told him all that had happened—from my meeting with
the carpenter, on the <span lang="fr">Champ de Mars</span>, to my visit to the
Jacobin Club.</p>

<p>“Very good,” said Drouet. “You passed last night
among the aristocracy—you shall pass this among the <i lang="fr">canaille</i>.”</p>

<p>“Shall we spend the night together?” cried I, joyously.</p>

<p>“Yes; I will take you to the Cordeliers, where you will
meet neither dukes, nor princes, nor marquises, but three
citizens, whom you tell me you have often thought of—to
wit, Marat, Danton, and Camille Desmoulins; in the
meantime, we will take a stroll round Paris.”</p>

<p>“What I wish most to see, M. Drouet, is the Bastille.”</p>

<p>“You mean to say, the place where it stood?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96"></a>[96]</span></p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Come along, then; we will breakfast at the first restaurant
we find, and then, hey! for the <span lang="fr">Place de la Bastille</span>.”</p>

<p>M. Drouet knew Paris very well, having been there
about twenty times.</p>

<p>We were not long before we arrived at a wall, on which
was written, in large letters:—</p>

<p class="pfs90">
“Here was the Bastille.”</p>

<p>Why did the germs of the Revolution suffocate themselves
under those dismal arches? Why, in 1300, did they
discourse the holy gospel? Why, during the captivity of
King John, did the Provost of Paris, Etienne Marcel,
making himself a dictator, establish a popular club there,
equal to that of the eighteenth century? Why were the
Cordeliers, especially, of all the minor orders of St. Francis,
republican in their tendencies—so much so, that, three
centuries before Barbeuf and Prudhomme, they had
dreamt the abolition of the rights of property?</p>

<p>The 13th of July was Vesuvius, with its fire-ejecting
crater, threatening to destroy Naples, and overturn the
world.</p>

<p>To-day, all has ended in smoke—with, perhaps, a few
cinders as a memorial.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XVII">CHAPTER XVII.<br>
<span class="fs70">I ATTEND A MEETING AT THE CORDELIERS.</span></h2>


<p>We were engulfed, so to speak, M. Drouet and I, in the
cave of the Cordeliers.</p>

<p>The hall was deep and broad, and lighted with smoky
lamps; a cloud formed by their smoke, and the breath of
the audience, floated over our heads, and seemed to weigh
heavily upon our chests.</p>

<p>There were no cards of admission—any one might come
who liked; the consequence was that the hall was crowded
to excess, and every one ran a chance of suffocation. At
the end of a minute, by means of vigorous pressure, we managed
to force a passage into the body of the hall.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97"></a>[97]</span></p>

<p>At first, we were obliged to keep our eyes shut, on account
of the smoky atmosphere; but when we got accustomed to
it, we could see objects, as it were, through a dense fog.</p>

<p>I raised myself up on tip-toe, to see the popular man, <i lang="fr">par
excellence</i>. All cried out, “Vive Lafayette!”</p>

<p>We passed the Tuileries, and the door of the clock-tower,
and gained a bridge. A sort of sympathy drew us to the
<span lang="fr">Champ de Mars</span>.</p>

<p>There was the same amount of bustle as on the day before.
A hundred thousand workmen were throwing up the
earth, and forming a valley between two hills.</p>

<p>The work progressed as if under the wave of an enchanter’s
rod. There was no doubt but that all would be ready
for the morrow, so that in seven days the gigantic undertaking
would have been completed. The middle of the place
was entirely clear. Here they erected the altar of the
country, and in front of the Ecole Militaire, built up seats
for the King and the Assembly.</p>

<p>At the end of a wooden bridge thrown over the river, near
Chaillot, they erected a triumphal arch.</p>

<p>It was impossible not to become maddened amid this confusion.
We could resist no longer, but seizing the nearest
implements that lay nearest at hand, we, with a shout of
“<span lang="fr">Vive la nation!</span>” set ourselves to work with the rest.</p>

<p>At six o’clock we ceased, heated with our exertions. We
were hungry. It was useless to look for a restaurant.</p>

<p>At eight o’clock we left the <span lang="fr">Champ de Mars</span>, and passing
through the <span lang="fr">Boulevards des Invalides</span>, and the <span lang="fr">Rue Plumet</span>,
we shaped our course to the Cordeliers.</p>

<p>An immense crowd of people—some fifty or sixty thousand,
perhaps—filled the place and the adjacent streets.</p>

<p>Those who had been unable to find lodgings had
encamped there, or on the Boulevards.</p>

<p>Being anxious to see historical localities, I asked M. Drouet
to take me to the <span lang="fr">Hotel de Ville</span>. We went up to the
Rue St. Antoine, M. Drouet showing me the steps on
which they had slain De Launay, the lantern on which
they had hung Foulon, and the corner of the quay where
they had killed Flesselles.</p>

<p>Everywhere—on the boulevards, in the places, in the
churches, on the bridges—all was gaiety; every one was
shaking hands with everybody; strangers in a moment<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98"></a>[98]</span>
became old friends. A shout of “<span lang="fr">Vive le Roi!</span>” surrounded
you with friends—a shout of “<span lang="fr">Vive la nation!</span>” with
brothers.</p>

<p>After dinner, we proceeded to the Jacobin Club. It was
crowded, like all the rest—if possible, more so.</p>

<p>“Look, look!” said M. Jean Baptiste, the moment it
was possible to see.</p>

<p>“Look! Where?” said I.</p>

<p>“There—on the President’s chair, between two candles!
Do you see any one?”</p>

<p>“Oh, M. Drouet!” said I, trembling.</p>

<p>“Well, what do you say?” asked he.</p>

<p>“I say that it is not a man whom you point out to me.”</p>

<p>“What is he, then?”</p>

<p>“A monster!”</p>

<p>“Good! Look at him for some length of time, and you
will get accustomed to his face, all hideous as it is.”</p>

<p>That man was M. Danton.</p>

<p>He rang the bell, and shook with a fury that seemed to
animate all he did.</p>

<p>In a moment all was silence.</p>

<p>His mouth, like the top of a cyclops, opened, and a voice,
which could have thundered down the noise had it continued,
pronounced these words, “It is Marat’s turn to
speak!”</p>

<p>Let us say a word or two about Marat before we proceed
any further.</p>

<p>Marat was born in 1744, at Neuchatêl. He was, at the
period of which I speak, forty-six years of age. His
mother, nervous and romantic, was ambitious enough to try
and make her son a second Rousseau. His father, a Protestant
clergyman, well read and hard-working, taught his
son the elements of science, and all the other branches of
knowledge that he was acquainted with, so that the young
man resembled a dictionary full of errors, and without even
method or form.</p>

<p>His grandfather nicknamed him Mara—the “t” is an
addition of his father’s, or his own. He had been a teacher
of languages in England, and understood English pretty
well. He also dabbled a little in physiology and chemistry,
but in a slight degree. In ’89 he became veterinary surgeon
to the Comte D’Artois.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99"></a>[99]</span></p>

<p>On the 14th of July, the day of the taking the Bastille,
he found himself on the Pont Neuf, and escaping being
crushed to death by a detachment of hussars. Marat ordered
them, in the name of the people, to throw down their arms—so
he said, at least, but no one believed it.</p>

<p>Marat was not brave. He hid himself all day for the
flight. He said that the satellites of Lafayette and De
Bailly were looking for him, whereas, in fact, they never
thought of him. In the evening, he crept out like a beast
of prey; his eye, yellow as that of an owl, seemed better
adapted for seeing in the dark than in the daylight. He
lived, creeping from hiding-place to hiding-place, never seeing
the light of day, and writing continually, imparting to
his compositions all the bitterness and acerbity of his
forced mode of life. From time to time he would exalt and
provoke himself to blood. They say that blood was his ordinary
drink—that he imbibed it when he was thirsty.
His physician shook his head, and said, “Marat writes
red.” His friends the journalists lifted him up to laugh at
him. They called him the divine Marat. The people took
a leaf out of their book, and called him a god. Let Marat
do what he liked, the people applauded. Marat did more
than lead them—he gave them room for amusement.</p>

<p>Amid the murmur of applause which greeted him—applause
which had been, in conjunction with silence,
denied to Robespierre the evening before—Danton, opening
the door of the rostrum, said, “It is Marat’s turn to
speak!”</p>

<p>Scarcely had the words been pronounced, when Marat
was seen mounting the steps leading to the rostrum, in
which he appeared, with a lurid smile on his coarse mouth,
seeming to embody, at one, and the same time, three distinct
genera: the man, the frog, and the serpent.</p>

<p>That <em>Thing</em>, dressed in almost rags, with dishevelled
hair, squinting eyes, broad nose, and hideous appearance,
was <em>the Friend of the People</em>! They had concluded by
giving Marat the name of his journal.</p>

<p>At last, his hideous head appearing over the ledge of the
rostrum, radiant with pride, and held, as it were, defiantly
back to hide a neck covered with ulcers, all cried out,
“Speak, Marat, speak!”</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied Marat, with a deep voice, “I am going
to.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100"></a>[100]</span></p>

<p>All was hushed, as if by magic. Danton covered his
face with his hands, and listened with a smile of scorn,
while a young man placed himself in front of the rostrum,
his arms crossed over his breast, in the attitude of a gladiator,
defying his enemy.</p>

<p>“Look—look!” said Drouet.</p>

<p>“At whom? Marat? I can see him.”</p>

<p>“No, no! that young man in front of the rostrum.”</p>

<p>“Who is he?”</p>

<p>“Camille Desmoulins, the man of the thirteenth of
July; the man of the <span lang="fr">Café de Foy</span>; the man of the green
cockade!”</p>

<p>“Silence! silence!” cried out several voices.</p>

<p>Marat, hearing a whisper, had turned his evil eyes on
us.</p>

<p>We became as still as mice.</p>

<p>“Great treason!” cried Marat; “but that is not wonderful—they
would not follow my advice; and I tell you
that until the heads of some of the National Assembly
ornament pikestaffs, things will go wrong. Do as I tell
you, and the Constitution will be perfect.”</p>

<p>“Why—why—why—don’t you send a mod-mod-model
to the Assembly?” said the young man, in front of the
rostrum, with a terrible and painful stutter in his speech.</p>

<p>“I am framing it,” said Marat, “while you make love,
Camille, I think.”</p>

<p>“Dream, you mean!” said the same satirical voice.</p>

<p>“Silence! silence!” cried the audience.</p>

<p>“Yes; I am preparing a scheme for our Constitution.”</p>

<p>“Tell—tell it us, great—great legislator!” said Camille,
totally disregarding the cries for silence.</p>

<p>“I say that the form of government should be monarchical,”
continued Marat; “that Monarchy is the
guiding-star of France, and that the person of the King
should be sacred, only to be approached through the medium
of his ministers.”</p>

<p>“Ah, aristocrat!” cried Camille.</p>

<p>“M. Danton,” cried Marat, furiously, “it is my turn to
speak, and I demand silence!”</p>

<p>“Silence! silence!” again cried the crowd.</p>

<p>“Citizen Camille,” said Danton, in a voice as satirical as
that of the man whom he reproved, “I call you to order!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101"></a>[101]</span></p>

<p>“Then ask the speaker,” said the imperturbable Camille,
“to give us part of his plans for the legislation.”</p>

<p>“Firstly,” cried Marat, “I demand that the blasphemer’s
tongue be cut out!”</p>

<p>“Well, cut my to-to-to-tongue out! I blas-blas-blaspheme!
I say Marat is a fool!”</p>

<p>And, suiting the action to the words, he protruded his
tongue at Marat, and made a grimace.</p>

<p>Some of the audience could not avoid laughing.</p>

<p>Marat was mad with rage.</p>

<p>“I again say,” said he, “in my project for our Constitution,
that the city is burdened with two hundred thousand
poor people. I argue the right of the poor to share.”</p>

<p>“Good!” said Camille. “We are ready; let us plun-plun-plunder!”</p>

<p>“Yes, plunder!” cried Marat, rapidly becoming more
and more excited. “When one has nothing, he has a right
to take the superfluities of the rich—rather than starve, he
has the right to take and devour their palpitating flesh!
Let man commit what outrage he likes on his fellow-men—it
is no worse than a wolf killing a sheep!”</p>

<p>“Marat has asked for me to be called to order: I ask
that he may be called to reason.”</p>

<p>“Why should I have pity on men?” yelled Marat.
“Firstly, pity is only a folly, acquired in society. In
nature, neither man nor inferior animals know pity. Does
Bailly, who tracks me, or Lafayette, who hunts me down,
or the National Guards, who seek to slay me, know pity?”</p>

<p>“Who prevents your eating them?” said Camille.</p>

<p>“No, no!” said Marat, sneering at Camille in his turn.
“No, I will not eat them; I will leave Lafayette to the
women, and will cry unto them, ‘Make him an Abelard!’
I will leave Bailly to the people, and will cry unto them,
‘Hang him, as you have hanged Foulon, as you have
hanged Flesselles!’ I will ask for the heads of the
National Guards—I will ask for the heads of the aristocrats—I
will ask, not for six hundred heads as I did yesterday,
but for nineteen thousand four hundred!”</p>

<p>“Make it twen-twenty thousand, round numbers!”</p>

<p>The admirers of Marat chafed. Marat’s mouth shut, his
eyes darted fire, his head was drawn back; he looked as if
he could have swallowed his adversary at one mouthful.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102"></a>[102]</span></p>

<p>The friends of Camille, Frérone, and Danton, the enemies
of Marat, took the part of Camille Desmoulins.</p>

<p>They would have come to blows, despite Danton’s continuously
ringing the bell for order, and his terrible voice
sounding far above the din, and crying, “Silence!
silence!”</p>

<p>I passed with M. Drouet to the side of Camille Desmoulins,
for whom I felt a sympathy as strong as my hatred of
Marat. The attention of all, however, was now drawn to
the entrance of a new personage, on whom all eyes were
fixed.</p>

<span class="fs70">THE FEMALE ELEMENT IN POLITICS.</span></h2>


<p>This new comer was a woman.</p>

<p>But a strange one, having a good deal of the masculine
in her composition—a perfect amazon—one might say a
virago.</p>

<p>She was habited in a long dress of red stuff, surmounted
by a cape; she wore a plumed hat, and a large sword at
her side.</p>

<p>I touched M. Drouet’s arm.</p>

<p>“Oh!” said I; “who is that?”</p>

<p>“I am no wiser at present than yourself,” said he;
“unless it is—yes, it is the famous Thèroigne de Méricourt.”</p>

<p>I had once or twice heard the name of the heroine of
the 5th and 8th of October—the impetuous Liègoise, beautiful,
but terrible; who, at Versailles, with a smile and soft
voice, had ordered the regiments of Flanders to lay down
their arms. An unhappy affection—the treason of an
unfaithful one, had thrust her out from woman’s life. She
had embraced the cause of the Revolution with transport.
It was her last love. The unhappy woman was whipped
by the Royalists in the Garden of the Tuileries, became
insane, and died in Bicetre, or Charenton, I forget which,
after twenty years of agony.</p>

<p>But at present she was young, pretty, proud, if not
happy. Alas! her misplaced love had seared her heart.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103"></a>[103]</span></p>

<p>Her entrance was great.</p>

<p>“There is the Queen of Sheba!” cried Camille Desmoulins,
stammering more than ever.</p>

<p>Then, turning to Danton, “Rise up, Solomon,” said he;
“and go and receive her Majesty!”</p>

<p>She stood boldly in front of Danton, put her hands on
the hilt of her sabre, and said, “If thou art Solomon, build
the temple. We have space enough on the site of the
Bastille, or better on the Field of the Federation. I will
head the subscription.”</p>

<p>She took a gold chain from off her neck, and threw it to
Danton.</p>

<p>“I ask to speak,” said a tall, fair man, with a strong
German accent; “to support the proposition of the Citizen
Thèroigne.”</p>

<p>“Citizen Anacharsis Clootz will address the meeting,”
said Danton. “Place to the orator of the human race.”</p>

<p>The Prussian Baron mounted the rostrum.</p>

<p>“Look!” said Drouet; “there is a republican who has a
hundred thousand crowns a year, and yet they say that only
the bootless and stockingless are revolutionists.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said he, with a soft smile and quiet voice, which
contrasted with the harshness of the former speaker; “yes,
I second the motion of Citizen Thèroigne. The temple
should be built in Paris. Why was Paris built at an equal
distance between the Pole and the Equator, if not to be the
centre of attraction for all men? At Paris will one day
assemble the Etats Généraux of all the world. You are
laughing, Camille, you eternal grinner. The day is not so
distant as you suppose. Oh, that the Tower of London
may fall as did the Bastille! Oh, that a second Cromwell
may rise from insignificance into power, and the tyrant of a
day will be seen no more! When the tricolor of liberty
floats, not over England and France alone, but over all the
world, there will then no longer be provinces, soldiers, and
vessels of war; here will be a people, and better than that, a
family. It will then be as easy to go from Paris to Pekin
as from Bordeaux to Strasbourg; the shores of the ocean
will be brought together by a bridge of ships; and the East
and the West will embrace on the <span lang="fr">Champ de la Fédération</span>.
Rome was the queen of nations by force of arms; Paris will
be the same by dint of peace. Think not that this is mere<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104"></a>[104]</span>
imagination, oh, my brothers! No, the more I think over
the matter, the more sure am I that I am right; and the
more I believe in the possibility of one great and united
nation. Oh, listen to the voice of reason; may patriotism
warm your hearts to build up a temple which will hold
all the representatives of the human race. Then ten
thousand men will suffice to represent the universe!”</p>

<p>“Bravo! bravo!” cried all from all sides.</p>

<p>“There are plenty of heads to chop off here and there,”
said Marat.</p>

<p>“Ye-ye-yes,” Stammered Camille Desmoulins; “six
hundred yes-yes-yesterday, nineteen thousand four hun-hundred
to-day; and if a to-morrow arrives, there will be fif-fif-fifty
thousand.”</p>

<p>“Anacharsis,” cried Danton, “you err, but on the side
of a good and generous heart.”</p>

<p>The terrible man looked at him with a soft smile, and he
continued: “Men will be what they ought to be, when
one can say, ‘The world is my country, the world is mine;’
but till then, there are more proscriptions, more banishments,
more exiles. Nature is one; why is not society
one? They are divided forces, which strike one another
when nations are driven against each other by the breath
of hatred, and, like clouds, they strike and are scattered.
Tyrants, we wish not that, and the proof is that we demand
not your death. Kill yourselves, slay each other. Descend,
O kings, from your thrones, and we will give you your
choice ’twixt misery and a scaffold. Usurpers of sovereignty!
Balthazars of modern times! is it possible that
you see not on your palace walls, amid the glare of your
thousand lamps, the shouts of your revelries, and the crash
of your song, the writing, not in fire, but in your people’s
blood, <i lang="fr">Mené, Mené! Tekel Upharsin</i>? Lay down your
sceptres and your crowns, and head a revolution which
delivers kings from the grasp of kings, and the people from
the rivalry of the people.”</p>

<p>“A-a-amen!” stammered Camille Desmoulins. “Ana-Anacharsis
wishes to carry me away by the hair of my
head, as the angel did Habakkuk.”</p>

<p>“Long live Camille Desmoulins!” said Thèroigne, while
the friends of the true son of Voltaire tendered him their
hands. “If ever I have love, it shall be for you, I promise
you. By the bye, you are fond of Sieyes?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105"></a>[105]</span></p>

<p>“Yes, truly,” replied Thèroigne. “Between you and
me, he is the only one who gives me the idea of a man.”</p>

<p>“What am I, then?” said Danton.</p>

<p>“What are you?” said Thèroigne, scanning him from
head to foot. “You are only a bull.”</p>

<p>“Well re-re-replied,” said Camille; “that is what I call
taking the bull by the horns.”</p>

<p>“In the meantime,” cried Marat, “you are losing sight
of the public safety. I speak to you of a great treason,
and you will not listen, Lafayette!”</p>

<p>“Ah, good!” said Camille. “Go on, Marat!”</p>

<p>“Lafayette has caused to be made in the Faubourg St.
Antoine ten thousand snuff-boxes, all of which are embellished
with his portrait as General of the National Guard.
Lafayette aspires to the dictatorship.”</p>

<p>“Of tobacco merchants?” queried Camille Desmoulins.</p>

<p>Marat’s yellow skin assumed a green tinge, and perspired
with rage.</p>

<p>“He has some scheme beneath that,” continued he; “so
I pray all good citizens in whose hands these snuff-boxes
may fall, to destroy them.”</p>

<p>“In order to discover the names of his accomplices?”
asked Camille.</p>

<p>“There are many of them. I told you that twenty
thousand pieces of cord would suffice, but bring thirty or
forty thousand, and you will not have enough.”</p>

<p>The applause drowned the voice of Marat, but eventually
their breath failed them, and they could hear Camille
Desmoulins, who, like a swimmer who had dived, again remounted
to the surface.</p>

<p>“Always tragic, friend Ma-Marat—always tragic! hypertragic,
in fact.”</p>

<p>“And these cords,” continued Marat—“take care,
Camille Desmoulins, that one of them is not first tried on
you.”</p>

<p>“In that case,” replied the incorrigible railer, “I have a
chance, if they take me, of growing ugly. You haven’t.”</p>

<p>Here the laughter broke out irresistibly, and as it arose
from Camille’s side, he may be fairly said to have gained
the victory.</p>

<p>Marat descended, furiously shaking his fist.</p>

<p>“Return to thy cave, night-bird! Go back to thy hole,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106"></a>[106]</span>
hyena! Sneak into thy nest, viper!” murmured Danton,
with a look of ineffable disdain. But Danton’s murmurs
were like thunder; every one heard them.</p>

<p>When Marat left, all joined in brotherly communion, his
presence having alone restrained them hitherto.</p>

<p>M. Jean Baptiste knew Danton, and went to shake
hands with him, and to compliment Camille Desmoulins.</p>

<p>I could not turn my eyes from the face of the ex-advocate,
that terrible blind man whom Providence had given
to guide the revolution.</p>

<p>I shall have occasion to speak again of him, and to show
what sensibility of heart was hidden beneath that rough
exterior.</p>

<p>We left the club at midnight, and returned to the
“<span lang="fr">Hotel des Postes</span>,” Rue Grange Batélière.</p>

<p>At daybreak on the morrow we had to be under arms.</p>

<span class="fs70">THE FIELD OF THE FEDERATION.</span></h2>


<p>I could not sleep all night.</p>

<p>I had seen so much since my arrival, and had been in
company with so many great men—Mirabeau, Robespierre,
Lameth, Laclos, Chemier, Talma, David, Laharpe, Danton,
Marat, Desmoulins, Anacharsis Clootz, and Herbert—that
their names continued to ring in my soul like an alarm
bell.</p>

<p>And through them all passed the beautiful amazon in
her red robe; and that seemed so strange to me, coming as
I had for the first time from the Forest of Argonne, and
feeling, as it were, in another world, or else in a state of
furious delirium.</p>

<p>I arose at daybreak. Alas! the morning was dark and
rainy-looking; thick black clouds were chasing each other
over the sky once so pure and brilliant, but now changing
its opinions, and becoming aristocratic.</p>

<p>I awoke M. Drouet. I was astonished that any one
could sleep on the night heralding in such a day. He<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107"></a>[107]</span>
jumped up and dressed himself. We took our guns, and
descended.</p>

<p>We soon joined our friends of St. Menehould and Islettes,
formed rank, and marched to the <span lang="fr">Champ de Mars</span>.</p>

<p>At the door of Sainte Honoré, we met the orator of the
human race, who had passed the night at the Cordeliers.</p>

<p>He had with him a body of men, Poles, Russians, Turks,
Persians, all in their national costumes. He took them to
the federation of France before he took them to the federation
of the world.</p>

<p>We marched by the river’s side, and soon arrived at the
<span lang="fr">Champ de Mars</span>.</p>

<p>A hundred and sixty thousand people were seated on the
slopes, a hundred and fifty thousand on the plain itself, and
yet there was sufficient space left to accommodate fifty
thousand of the National Guard.</p>

<p>A second amphitheatre in a semi-circle formed in the
space between Chaillot and Passy accommodated more than
a hundred thousand people.</p>

<p>Anacharsis Clootz was right. This looked well for a federation
of the world.</p>

<p>We crossed the river by the wooden bridge thrown over it
at Chaillot, and passing under the <span lang="fr">Arc de Triomphe</span>, entered
the <span lang="fr">Champ de Mars</span>, and arranged ourselves in front of
the altar of the country. The honors were for the provincial
National Guard.</p>

<p>We were removed only a hundred paces from the raised
seats destined for the King, the Queen, and the National
Assembly.</p>

<p>All in a moment it began to rain. It was now eight
o’clock, and as the King and Queen were not expected till
ten, there was plenty of time to get both wet and cold.
Some of the National Guards began to dance a farandole to
keep the warmth in them; the example was contagious,
the muskets were stacked, and each man choosing a partner
from among the female spectators, the extraordinary spectacle
of two thousand people dancing at one time commenced.</p>

<p>At half-past ten the cannon announced the arrival of the
King, and the drum recalled each man to his post. The
female dancers were re-conducted to their friends, and the
guard presented arms.</p>

<p>The carriages of the King, Queen, and other dignitaries<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108"></a>[108]</span>
of the realm came at a foot pace. They stopped at the
raised benches; the King, descending first, gave his hand
to the Queen, and they took their respective places, accompanied
by the Assembly.</p>

<p>Now, not only had the day, but the moment arrived.</p>

<p>Stationed close to the benches, of which we had an
excellent view, I had been awaiting with impatience the
arrival of the King and Queen, of whose personal appearance
I had formed my own ideas, which I am bound to say
were very far from the truth.</p>

<p>The King was not sufficiently kingly. The Queen was
too much a queen.</p>

<p>While the King was bowing to the people, and seating
himself in the midst of the cries of “<span lang="fr">Vive le Roi!</span>” M. de
Talleyrand, the lame bishop, the Mephistopheles to another
Faust, whose name was Napoleon, proceeded, attended by
two hundred priests, to the altar of the country. All wore
tri-colored sashes.</p>

<p>The regimental bands strike up, but are scarcely heard.
But forty pieces of cannon, discharged at the same time,
command silence.</p>

<p>The taking of the oath followed.</p>

<p>Three hundred thousand hands are uplifted at one and
the same time on the <span lang="fr">Champ de Mars</span>. The rest of France
was joined in spirit to those who swore in the name of all.</p>

<p>They had hoped that the King would descend from his
seat, mount the altar, and there, holding up his hand,
swear in the sight of all his people.</p>

<p>They were mistaken. The King swore from his seat,
placed in the shadow—in fact, almost hidden. The idea
that struck the hearts of all, was that the King swore with
regret, and without intending to keep the oath that he had
taken.</p>

<p>This was the oath that all knew beforehand, but which
few could hear, thanks to the fashion in which the King
spoke:—</p>

<p>“I, King of the French, swear to the nation to employ
all the power which has been delegated to me by constitutional
law, in maintaining the constitution and executing
the laws.”</p>

<p>Ah, King, King! it is with greater heart and better
faith that your people have sworn.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109"></a>[109]</span></p>

<p>The Queen did not swear; she sat in a reserved seat,
with the Dauphin and the princesses. On hearing the
King’s voice trembling and hesitating she smiled, a singular
light gleaming in her eyes the while.</p>

<p>M. Drouet, as well as myself, remarked that smile, and
he frowned.</p>

<p>“Ah, M. Drouet,” said I, “I like not that smile! And
I never could have believed that that beautiful Queen could
have smiled in such a fashion.”</p>

<p>“The Queen’s smile matters little,” replied M. Drouet.
“The King has sworn—that is the great point. The oath
is registered at this moment in the hearts of twenty-five
millions of Frenchmen. It will be worse for him if the
oath be not kept.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Every time that I have been to Paris since that day, I
have paid a visit to the <span lang="fr">Champ de Mars</span>, the only monument
left of the Revolution.</p>

<p>The last time I made the pilgrimage was in 1853. I had
come to buy the History of the French Revolution, by
Michelet.</p>

<p>I seated myself on a hillock, and much in the same way
as M. Chateaubriand on the ruins of Sparta, cried out in a
loud voice, three times, “Leonidas! Leonidas! Leonidas!”
I read aloud the following lines of the eloquent historian,
which chimed in so well with my own thoughts:—</p>

<p>“The <span lang="fr">Champ de Mars</span> is the sole monument left of the
Revolution. The Empire has the <span lang="fr">Arc de Triomphe</span>. Royalty
has its Louvre and its Invalides. The feudal Church
of 1,200 has its throne in Notre Dame.</p>

<p>“But the Revolution has alone for its monument an
empty space.</p>

<p>“This monument is sand, and desert as the plains of
Arabia. A mound to the right, a mound to the left, like
those which the Gauls erected in memory of their fallen
heroes.</p>

<p>“Though the plain be dry, and the grass be withered,
still a day will come when it shall be again clothed in
green.</p>

<p>“For mingled with this earth is the sweat of the brow of
those who on a sacred day raised these hills—on a day<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110"></a>[110]</span>
when, awakened by the cannon of the Bastille, France poured
in from the north and south—on a day when three millions
as one man swore eternal peace.</p>

<p>“Ah! poor Revolution, so confiding in the first blush of
thy youth, thou hast invited the world to love and peace.</p>

<p>“Oh, my enemies! said’st thou, there are no longer enemies.</p>

<p>“Thou heldest out thine hand to all—thou hast offered
the cup to drink to the peace of nations, but they would
not.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XX">CHAPTER XX.<br>
<span class="fs70">I GO BACK AGAIN.</span></h2>


<p>We arranged to leave Paris on the following morning.</p>

<p>It was three hours after noontide when the ceremony was
over. I made a rendezvous with M. Drouet for five o’clock
at the “<span lang="fr">Hotel des Postes</span>,” and left him to give my thanks
and bid adieu to Maître Duplay and his family.</p>

<p>All the household had been to the fête of the federation.</p>

<p>I met the group, consisting of M. and Madame Duplay,
the two daughters, and the two apprentices, at the top of
the Rue St. Honoré.</p>

<p>I went up to and saluted them.</p>

<p>They, too, had remarked the hesitation with which the
King took the oath, and were, in consequence, sorrowful.</p>

<p>We entered the house; the dinner awaited us; Duplay
invited me to join them; I assented.</p>

<p>During the meal, Félicién, sure of his superiority over
me as a fencer, spoke of the promise I had made to try a
bout with him; and asked me, if, after dinner, I was prepared
to stand by our agreement, and give M. Duplay and
his daughters, the pleasure of witnessing our prowess. I
replied that if it would please my worthy hosts, I should
only be too happy to make such a slight return for their
kindness and hospitality towards me.</p>

<p>Dinner finished, we passed into the workshop, Félicién
evidently expecting an easy victory over me, and speaking
much as a master would to a pupil.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111"></a>[111]</span></p>

<p>M. Duplay and the young ladies being seated, we each
took our mask and foil.</p>

<p>“Be easy,” said Félicién, in a whisper intended to be
heard; “I will not hurt you.”</p>

<p>“Thanks!” replied I; “for I shall probably be at your
mercy.”</p>

<p>“Would you like to begin?” asked Félicién.</p>

<p>“As you please,” said I.</p>

<p>We placed ourselves on guard.</p>

<p>At the first pass, I saw that Félicién tried to touch me;
which, between strangers, lacks courtesy.</p>

<p>However, I appeared not to notice it, and contented myself
by parrying his thrust.</p>

<p>Now came my turn.</p>

<p>I made four or five passes only; but they were sufficient
to show me that, though Félicién was a tolerable fencer, he
had no chance with me.</p>

<p>I had paid great attention to the instructions given me,
as I wished to make rapid progress; while Bertrand being
an able master, and I his sole scholar, he was enabled to
devote all his attention to me.</p>

<p>Félicién, also, after the first few passes, perceived my
superiority over him.</p>

<p>I allowed him to make five or six thrusts at me, simply
contenting myself with parrying them.</p>

<p>Once he grazed the wristband of my shirt, but he did
not dare say “Touched!”</p>

<p>I saw the blood mount to his face.</p>

<p>“My dear Félicién,” said I, “I have been three hours
under arms, and am fatigued. If you will allow me, I
should like to put an end to our combat. The ladies, I am
sure, will accept my excuse.”</p>

<p>“They may, but I will not,” said he. “I know full
well, by the strength of your parries, that your arm is not
fatigued. Say that you believe yourself to be a better
fencer than I am, and that you are generous enough not to
pursue your advantage.”</p>

<p>“Then you wish to continue?”</p>

<p>“Certainly. If you are the better man, I will take the
lesson, as an obedient scholar should.”</p>

<p>“You hear the promise that M. Félicién makes,” said I,
turning to M. Duplay; “and you are witness that I continue
solely on that agreement?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112"></a>[112]</span></p>

<p>“Yes, yes!” cried all the spectators, especially the two
girls, who seemed to me to wish the pride of the apprentice
lowered.</p>

<p>I saluted Félicién with my foil.</p>

<p>“I await you,” said I; “take care of my ripostas, which
are very rapidly delivered.”</p>

<p>“We will see,” said Félicién, dealing me a thrust which I
had only just time to parry.</p>

<p>But, at last, I touched, almost imperceptibly, his breast
with the button of my foil.</p>

<p>He bounded backwards; and while neither of us cried
“<em>Touched?</em>” yet all the spectators saw that it was so.</p>

<p>He again rushed on me, his teeth set, his lips pale.</p>

<p>He crossed my foil, and passed <em>one, two</em>. But in retreat,
his foil caught my guard, and snapped off, about two
inches from the button.</p>

<p>But he continued to fight, as if he knew not that his
weapon was broken. So I took the first opportunity that
offered; and, twisting his blade out of his hand, sent it
flying across the room.</p>

<p>“Pardon me,” said I, “for disarming you; I know that
it is not etiquette; but neither is it etiquette to fence with
a buttonless foil. You might have dangerously wounded
me, and been unhappy yourself ever afterwards.”</p>

<p>Then, taking off my mask, I hung it on the wall, and
placed my foil by the side of it.</p>

<p>Félicién saw plainly that I did not wish to continue the
combat; and, without taking off his mask, he stalked out
of the room.</p>

<p>“Ah!” cried M. Duplay; “you have read him a good
lesson, and I must say that he deserved it. Now then, say
good-bye to the ladies, and let us be off to the Rue Grange
Batélière, where you will introduce me to M. Drouet. I
need not tell you that if I hear of your coming to Paris
without paying me a visit, I shall be your bitter enemy
for life.”</p>

<p>I bade the two girls good-bye, and we set out.</p>

<p>As I expected, Félicién was awaiting us in the court.</p>

<p>The moment he saw me come out with M. Duplay, who
evidently only came with me to prevent a quarrel, Félicién
began to divest himself of his upper garments; but
M. Duplay cried out, “Come here, you young vagabond!—I
tell you, come here!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113"></a>[113]</span></p>

<p>Félicién approached unwillingly.</p>

<p>“Give your hand to my young friend here—he has a
right to it.”</p>

<p>“Has what?” asked Félicién.</p>

<p>“Nothing,” I hastened to reply. “M. Duplay believes
that you knew your foil to be unbuttoned, but I have told
him ‘no!’ Come; shake hands, and be friends.”</p>

<p>I held out my hand.</p>

<p>Félicién took it with rather a bad grace.</p>

<p>“There,” said M. Duplay; “you have said adieu! We
go our way—you can go yours.”</p>

<p>And he dismissed him with a wave of his hand.</p>

<p>We went our way.</p>

<p>“You see, I was right in coming out with you,” said
M. Duplay. “The little scoundrel was waiting there to pick
a quarrel with you. He would not be a bad carpenter if
he would work, but he thinks the trade beneath him. He
loves, and is jealous of Cornelie. One can easily see that,
but he is eighteen months younger than she. I don’t think
that Cornelie is very fond of him; but you have given a
lesson to M. Veto, and you have done well.”</p>

<p>I did not reply, as I agreed in every respect with
M. Duplay.</p>

<p>As the clock struck five, we arrived at the Rue Grange
Batélière. We found M. Drouet punctual. I introduced
M. Duplay, whom he already knew through my speaking
of him.</p>

<p>We spent the evening fraternising with the Parisians.</p>

<p>We each of us received a medal in commemoration of
the occasion.</p>

<p>At five o’clock in the morning, the drum beat the recall.
We formed ranks, and set out for the Barrier Pantin.
Meaux was fixed upon as our first halting-place.</p>

<p>Four days after our departure from Paris, we arrived at
Menehould about three hours after mid-day. We had, on
an average, marched about twelve leagues a day.</p>

<p>M. Drouet wished me to dine with him, but I knew that
my uncle would be uneasy if I returned not with the
others; and, somehow or other, I had a presentiment that I
must hasten, if I wished to see him alive.</p>

<p>I was a quick walker. I ran down the slope of the
mountain, and traversed the village at a quick trot.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114"></a>[114]</span></p>

<p>On passing the priest’s house, I saw Mademoiselle
Marguerite in the doorway. When she saw me, she came
forward.</p>

<p>I feared what she was going to ask; so I at once said,
“M. le Curé is in capital health, and will be here in an
hour. What news of my uncle?”</p>

<p>“Good, my dear Réné—good; but you have mentioned
to him your arrival?”</p>

<p>“No, I have not. Why should I?”</p>

<p>“Well, he told me that you would arrive at half-past
seven this evening; and he said, ‘Thank heaven, I shall
be able to see and bless him before I die!’”</p>

<p>“He said that? Well, I must hurry on, for I have no
time to lose.”</p>

<p>On leaving the village, and turning the first angle of the
forest, one could see the cottage of Father Descharmes.</p>

<p>I turned the corner in a moment.</p>

<p>Father Descharmes was at the door, seated in his arm-chair,
in the same place I had left him, enjoying the rays
of the setting sun.</p>

<p>I waved my hat on the end of my musket. I thought
that he feebly waved his hand in return.</p>

<p>I ran quicker than ever; and the nearer I came the more
his face brightened up.</p>

<p>When I was not more than ten paces distant, he lifted
himself from the chair, and, raising his eyes to heaven, he
said “I knew well that I should see my child again. ‘Now
let Thy servant depart in peace, according to Thy word.’”</p>

<p>I heard these words, and threw myself on my knees.</p>

<p>“Bless me, oh, my uncle!” I cried.</p>

<p>My voice was choked with sobs, for I saw that I had
arrived just in time to receive his last breath.</p>

<p>I felt the old man’s hands placed upon my forehead, and
I fancied that I heard his voice murmuring feebly a
prayer.</p>

<p>When the prayer was finished, he cried, “Oh, heaven,
receive my spirit!”</p>

<p>I felt his hand slowly slipping from my brow.</p>

<p>I stayed a moment immovable, and then, taking his
hands in mine, I raised myself gently, and looked at him.</p>

<p>He had fallen backwards, his head resting on his breast,
and his eyes and mouth open.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115"></a>[115]</span></p>

<p>But the mouth no longer had breath, and the light had
departed from the eyes.</p>

<p>He was dead!</p>

<span class="fs70">I EXCHANGE MY GUN FOR THE PLANE.</span></h2>


<p>I will not exaggerate my grief; I will simply say that
I loved my uncle as a father, and my sorrow for his loss was
full and sincere.</p>

<p>In my absence, the two keepers—the one named Flobert,
and the other, Lafeuille—had taken it in turns to minister
to his little wants.</p>

<p>When he died, Flobert was in the house. I called, and
he came to me.</p>

<p>The name of Drouet filled my heart, and rested on my
lips.</p>

<p>At that moment a post-chaise passed, going in the direction
of St. Menehould. I ran after the postilion, my eyes
filled with tears.</p>

<p>“Tell M. Jean Baptiste,” cried I to him, “that my uncle
died at the moment of my arrival.”</p>

<p>“Is it possible? Poor Descharmes! I spoke to him
yesterday! He was seated in his easy-chair, in the doorway,
and he told me that he expected you this evening.”</p>

<p>He then drove on.</p>

<p>“You will not forget to tell M. Drouet, will you?” I repeated.</p>

<p>“Certainly not. Do not be afraid, M. Réné; I shall not
forget it.”</p>

<p>I had such confidence in M. Drouet, that I did not think
it necessary to ask him to come. I had only to tell him my
sorrow, and I knew that he would come.</p>

<p>As I expected, two hours after, I heard the gallop of a
horse. I rushed to the door, and M. Drouet was there.</p>

<p>He had met M. Fortin as he was coming in the same carriage
which had taken him to the Federation. He had
pressed on his steed; he had seen Marguerite in passing;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116"></a>[116]</span>
and in all probability the good priest would be there in an
hour, with his housekeeper, to say the prayers for the dead
by the bedside of Father Descharmes.</p>

<p>M. Drouet wished to lead me away; but, smiling, in the
midst of my tears, “What would my poor uncle say of me
on high,” I said, “if any other hand than mine performed
the last sad offices for the dead?”</p>

<p>“Do you feel yourself strong enough for it?” asked
M. Drouet.</p>

<p>“Is it not my duty?”</p>

<p>“Without doubt. But one cannot always do one’s
duty.”</p>

<p>“I hope that heaven will always give me strength
enough to perform mine.”</p>

<p>“Breathe that prayer night and morning, and it will be
of more benefit than all the prayers printed in the Church
Service.”</p>

<p>The burial was to take place at four o’clock in the Cemetery
of Islettes. After it was over, he proposed that I
should go with him to St. Menehould, to pass the night,
and in the following morning with a notary, who would arrange
the deceased man’s papers &amp;c., &amp;c.</p>

<p>In the afternoon, at four o’clock, my uncle’s corpse, accompanied
by the whole village of Islettes, followed by me,
his sole relative, and by Drouet, Billard, Guillaume, Mathieu,
and Bertrand, his friends, was placed in its last resting-place,
accompanied by the blessings of the Abbé Fortin,
and all those who knew his upright and irreproachable life.</p>

<p>The funeral over, M. Drouet put the key of the cottage
in his own pocket. Then we mounted into M. Drouet’s
cabriolet, and drove off to St. Menehould.</p>

<p>In the evening, M. Drouet went to seek the notary, who
promised to run over the following day, after breakfast, to
open the will, and make an inventory. On the morrow, at
mid-day, in the presence of MM. Fortin, Drouet, Bertrand,
and Mathieu, the will was opened.</p>

<p>It appointed me his sole heir, and at the same time indicated
a cupboard in which would be found, in a bag, two
hundred and sixty louis d’or, which comprised his whole
fortune.</p>

<p>It also charged me to give all the little things he had
collected, and which were of no use to me, to the poor of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117"></a>[117]</span>
the village of Islettes; also to give all the implements of
the chase, with the exception of those which pleased me, to
his old friends, Flobert and Lafeuille.</p>

<p>On no account was anything to be sold.</p>

<p>As I was under age, M. Drouet, by my uncle’s wish, became
my guardian.</p>

<p>As a matter of course, I immediately handed over to him
the two hundred and sixty louis which my uncle had left
me, telling him to keep them till I came of age.</p>

<p>All being thus arranged, I placed on a wheelbarrow,
which Bertrand lent me, all my carpentry tools, my compasses,
my plane, and so on.</p>

<p>Two hours after, I arrived at M. Gerbaut’s. On my
entrance, I found the whole family at supper.</p>

<p>“M. Gerbaut,” said I, “you offered me, if at any time
I desired to work under a master, an apprenticeship—are
you inclined to stand by your agreement?”</p>

<p>“Thanks, my boy, for having thought first of me. But
sit down and eat; it will be time enough to think of work
to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“Sit down by my side, my friend,” said Sophie, with a
sweet smile, holding out her hand.</p>

<p>She drew her chair a little nearer to her father’s, and I
accepted the place thus offered.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXII">CHAPTER XXII.<br>
<span class="fs70">MY NEW LIFE UNDER SOPHIE’S FATHER.</span></h2>


<p>The changes made by death excepted, there is this
strange and touching peculiarity of country life, that, whilst
kingdoms are rent, hedgerows, and fields, and rustics,
apparently remain ever the same.</p>

<p>Nearly a year had passed since I last set foot in Father
Gerbaut’s house, and on entering I found everything the
same as when I had last left it; the covers laid in the same
places, on the same table, and for the same number of
persons. Not only were material affairs the same, but the
affections remained unaltered. Sophie had said, “Come,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118"></a>[118]</span>
my brother,” and I came. She gave me her hand, and
said, “Brother, you are welcome!”</p>

<p>And yet a great agitation prevailed over the whole surface
of France; all the ancient names of the provinces had
been changed. France was divided into eighty-three
departments. One part of Champagne had taken the
names of the Department of the Meuse; the part neighboring
was now the Department of the Marne. The little
River Biesme, which served as a line of demarcation
between Germany and France, and, likewise, between
Champagne and Clermontois, fixed the limit of the two
departments. Les Islettes, Clermont, and Varennes were
in the Department of the Meuse.</p>

<p>Municipalities were constituted under the name of corporations;
M. Gerbaut was nominated municipal councillor,
and our neighbor, M. Sauce, grocer, procureur of the
corporation.</p>

<p>I say our neighbor, because the two houses were separated
only by a lane.</p>

<p>The two families frequently visited each other. M. Gerbaut
and M. Sauce, with their blushing honors thick upon
them, were patriots.</p>

<p>Madame Sauce was a fine woman, but coarse and vulgar,
a veritable dealer in candles, butter, and sugar; rather
given to serving short measure, but otherwise incapable of
committing a fraud. The mother of M. Sauce, an old lady
of sixty-three or sixty-four years, was a Royalist. The
children, the eldest of whom was only twelve, were incapable
of having an opinion.</p>

<p>We shall see presently what Sophie’s opinions were.</p>

<p>Opposite us was the tavern of the “Bras d’Or,” belonging
to the brothers Leblanc. Interest made them play a
little comedy. As they had the patronage both of the
patriotic young men in the town, and the Royalist young
nobles from the vicinity, the one brother was a patriot, and
the other a Royalist. The elder cried “<span lang="fr">Vive la nation</span>”
with the young tradesmen, while the younger shouted
“<span lang="fr">Vive le Roi</span>” with the noblesse.</p>

<p>In the midst of all this, a national decree was propagated,
which caused some uneasiness in the province.</p>

<p>It was the civil constitution of the clergy.</p>

<p>It created an episcopal chair in each department.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119"></a>[119]</span></p>

<p>It ordered the election of bishops and priests to be conducted
after the fashion of the primitive church: that is to
say, that they were to be elected by a majority of votes; all
the salaries of the clergy were to be paid from the King’s
treasury; perquisites were abolished.</p>

<p>The clergy were desired to take an oath to maintain that
constitution; those who would not, were compelled to resign
their benefices in favor of those who would.</p>

<p>If, after being dismissed, they attempted to renew their
functions, they were prosecuted as disturbers of the public
peace.</p>

<p>From this arose the troubles in the Church, and the
division between the constitutional priests and those who
refused to take the oath.</p>

<p>If one looks back on that great epoch, and on the two
remarkable years of ’89 and ’90, one cannot fail to be
astonished. Can any one explain the precautions taken by
nature, that the men and the events should arrive at the
same time for that awful result which followed?</p>

<p>In 1762, M. de Choiseul suppressed the order of the
Jesuits; that is to say, deprived the Church of its wisest
and most powerful supporters.</p>

<p>Afterwards, in the years ’68, ’69, and ’70, the Revolution
produced Chateaubriand, Bonaparte, Hoch, Marceau, Joubert,
Cuvier, Saint Martin, Saint Simon, Lesneur, Les
Cheniers, Geoffrey Saint Hilaire, Bichat, Lainancourt, all
of whom, in 1792, were in the bloom of life and genius.</p>

<p>Whence came those births sublime and terrible, produced
in the space of three or four years? Whence came
that burst of genius prepared twenty-four or twenty-five
years before to second political eruption? Whence came
that body of superior men who closed the eighteenth and
opened the nineteenth century? Whence came that phalanx
more than human, and who raised the hand to
swear to the constitution before the altar of their country?</p>

<p>Let us forget the death of Mirabeau, the last upholder of
the monarchy, whom heaven struck in an unexpected manner,
at the moment he forsook the cause of the people; and
who, in dying, counselled the flight of the king—a flight
which, had it succeeded, would have saved the life of his
Majesty; but successful or unsuccessful, must inevitably
have brought the monarchy to the ground.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120"></a>[120]</span></p>

<p>All knew not the cause of that reason or corruption on
the part of Mirabeau; whether it was that his aristocratic
instincts, kept under for a time by his father’s severity, had
sprung into light on contact with royalty, or not, seemed
to be doubtful.</p>

<p>The Queen was a great enchantress. She was a Circe,
fatal to those who stopped not their ears, to avoid listening
to the blandishments of her sweet voice. She had the fatal
gift, which Mary Stuart possessed, of leading all her friends
to death.</p>

<p>The end of Mirabeau was announced in the provinces
almost at the same time as his illness.</p>

<p>It was on the 20th of March that the news of his illness
was bruited about in Paris. It appeared that on the 27th,
two days previous, being at his house at Argenteuil, he was
seized with a violent cholic, accompanied with almost unendurable
agony. He sent for his friend and physician,
the famous Cabanis, and distinctly refused to see any
other. This was wrong, perhaps; a hospital surgeon or a
practised physician might have saved him.</p>

<p>As soon as the news was received, the crowd pressed to
the door of the sick man’s house.</p>

<p>Barnave, his enemy, almost his rival, who would have
died, slain by the Queen, for an interview like that which
Mirabeau had had with her, came to see him conducting a
deputation of Jacobins.</p>

<p>The priest came, and would not be denied. This was
exactly what Mirabeau feared—the influence of priests upon
his dying volition.</p>

<p>They refused admission to the sick man’s chamber, saying
that Mirabeau wished only to see his friend M. Talleyrand,
to whom, he said, he could confess, without any great fear
of virtuous indignation.</p>

<p>For some months he had been suffering, he believed, from
the effects of poison. Administered by whom? He would
have been puzzled to tell that himself. All the world, except
the parties interested, knew about his interview with
the Queen at St. Cloud, in the month of May, 1790.
Whether his malady was natural, or the effects of a crime,
he took no measures whatever to arrest its progress.</p>

<p>Vigorous of body, perhaps more vigorous in imagination,
he had passed the night of the 15th of March in an orgie,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121"></a>[121]</span>
the component parts of which were women and flowers,
perhaps the sole two things that he loved. He used money
simply to gratify his tastes in those respects.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 2nd of April, after a night of
agony, which inspired the famous prophecy, “I carry with
me the mourning of monarchy; its remains will be the prey
of factions,”—awakened from the bosom of grief, if one can
use the term, by a cannon-shot, he cried.</p>

<p>He summoned his valet, was shaved, washed, and perfumed
all over his body. After his last toilette was completed,
opening his window to admit the young April sun,
which was brightening the first blossoms on the trees, he
murmured, smiling, “Oh, sun, if thou art not God himself,
thou art his cousin german!”</p>

<p>Afterwards, his last insupportable suffering seized him.
He could not speak, but snatched a pen, and wrote plainly
the one word <i lang="fr">Dormir</i>—“Sleep.”</p>

<p>Did he ask for death, like Hamlet, or only for opium to
soothe his passage from one world into the other?</p>

<p>At about half-past eight, he moved, lifted his eyes to
heaven, and heaved a sigh. It was his last!</p>

<p>In the evening, the theatres were closed, as if some great
national calamity had occurred.</p>

<p>The mask was taken from that immobile face; from that
powerful head which Camille Desmoulins called a magazine
of ideas exploded by death. His placid brow expressed the
serenity of his soul, and his face bore no trace of either
grief or remorse.</p>

<p>There is no doubt but that Mirabeau, when he promised
the Queen all his support, fully intended to keep that
promise, not only as a gentleman but as a citizen.</p>

<p>The funeral ceremony took place on the 4th of April;
four hundred thousand persons followed in the procession.
Two instruments were heard for the first time on that
occasion, filling the breasts of the spectators with their vibrating
notes: they were the trombone, and the tom-tom.</p>

<p>At eight in the evening, he was placed in the temporary
tomb provided for him in the Pantheon.</p>

<p>We say temporary, because his body remained there only
three years.</p>

<p>It was removed at the time when the Convention, having
slain the Jacobins, and slain itself, having no more living to
slay, determined to dishonor the dead.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122"></a>[122]</span></p>

<p>It was ordered that the corpse of Honoré Riquette de
Mirabeau, traitor to the people, traitor to his country, and
sold to royalty, should be removed from the Pantheon.</p>

<p>The order was executed, and the corpse of Mirabeau was
thrown into the criminals’ cemetery, at Clamart.</p>

<p>It is there that he now sleeps the sleep of hope, waiting
the day when France, an indulgent—nay, let us rather say
an impartial mother, will give him, not a Pantheon, but a
tomb; not a temple, but a <em>mausoleum</em>.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXIII">CHAPTER XXIII.<br>
<span class="fs70">THE ARRIVAL OF THE DRAGOONS.</span></h2>


<p>During the ten months that I stayed with M. Gerbaut,
my life was monotonous in the extreme.</p>

<p>As I was an excellent workman, he gave me, as well as
board and lodging, a salary of thirty francs a month, and
often gave me to understand that he wished that I were a
few years older, that he might give me his daughter in
marriage, and surrender to me his business. But the fact
was, I was a year younger than Sophie.</p>

<p>But it was not that only which rendered a union impossible
between us; it was that invincible sorrow, denoting a
passion hidden in the depths of her heart.</p>

<p>My opinion was, that the young man for whom she
entertained this hidden feeling was the Viscount de Malmy.</p>

<p>Sophie gave me all that she had promised—sisterly love.</p>

<p>It was impossible to be kinder or more affectionate to
me than she was. On Sunday, I invariably took her out
for a walk, and she never would accept any other arm than
mine; but this friendship did not induce her to confide to
me the cause of the sorrow which I could plainly see was
preying upon her constitution.</p>

<p>Sometimes the young nobles came, and, as I have told
you, put up at the Brothers Leblanc.</p>

<p>On those days, Sophie always found a pretext for not
going out with me, taking care that the pretext was plausible.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123"></a>[123]</span></p>

<p>She shut herself up in her chamber, the window of
which was exactly opposite the window of the “Bras d’Or,”
and stayed there the whole time that the young nobles
were at Varennes.</p>

<p>More than once, under these circumstances, I had half a
mind to get up in the night, and see if the darkness hid
any mystery with regard to Sophie and the Viscount, but
I always had strength enough to resist the temptation. I
thought to myself I had no right to surprise any of her
secrets, which, notwithstanding our friendship, she had not
thought fit to confide in me.</p>

<p>One night, whilst passing along the corridor, I fancied I
heard two voices in Sophie’s room; but instead of stopping
to listen, I felt ashamed of the action which jealousy
prompted me to commit, and I determined, notwithstanding
the pangs I suffered, that Sophie should have no reason
to suppose that I suspected anything.</p>

<p>My grief, undoubtedly, was great; but my pity for her
was greater, and I felt that strong as my anguish was, she
was preparing for herself an after day of sorrow and remorse.</p>

<p>From the 1st to the 15th of June, the visits of M. Malmy
and M. Dampierre were more frequent than usual.</p>

<p>An instinctive hatred made me keep aloof from M. de
Malmy; but the Count, in memory of Father Descharmes,
never met me without speaking.</p>

<p>But, for the most part, they did not come as far as the <span lang="fr">Rue
de la Basse Cour</span>. M. de Malmy alone, and his friend the
Viscount de Courtemont, went to the “<span lang="fr">Bras d’Or</span>;” the
Count de Haus stayed on the top of the Hill <span lang="fr">des Réligieuses</span>
with one of his friends, an old Chevalier of St. Louis, named
the Baron de Préfontaine.</p>

<p>On the 20th of June, about three o’clock in the afternoon,
M. Jean Baptiste arrived.</p>

<p>In the course of the ten months since I had last been at
Varennes, he had paid two or three visits to his friends Billaud
and Guillaume, and had never failed to come and see
me, and to invite me to take breakfast with him, as the case
might be.</p>

<p>This time he had a more mysterious air than usual; he
engaged a private room at the Brothers Leblanc, ordered
dinner for four, and asked his two friends to come and join
us immediately at the “Bras d’Or.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124"></a>[124]</span></p>

<p>For some time the horizon had been lowering.</p>

<p>It was evident that there was some counterplot hatching.</p>

<p>On the 1st of March we had heard of the affair of the
Gentlemen of the Dagger.</p>

<p>On the 20th of April, we had heard that the King, intending
to go to St. Cloud, had been stopped by the people,
and was afraid to leave the Tuileries.</p>

<p>We knew, vaguely, what was going on in Italy. The
Count D’Artois was at Mantua with the Emperor Leopold,
asking for an invasion of France. The King did not ask
that invasion; but D’Artois knew well that he would be
glad of it. A year before, everybody saw, from the letter
from the Count de Provence to M. de Favras, how little
place the King held in the calculations of his brothers.</p>

<p>The young King of Sweden, Gustavus, after having been
the enemy of Catharine, conquered by her, became her
friend, and at the same time her agent, and was at Aix, in
Savoy, publicly offering his sword to the King; while the
Count de Fersen, an intimate of the Queen’s, was carrying
on a correspondence with M. de Bouillé.</p>

<p>People said that for the last three months the Queen had
caused to be made a trousseau for herself and children.</p>

<p>They said, likewise, that she had caused to be made a
magnificent travelling outfit, sufficient for at least an absence
of six months.</p>

<p>Her friend, M. de Fersen, they said, was superintending
the construction of an English chaise, capable of holding
from ten to twelve persons.</p>

<p>All these rumors tended to one end, and caused the two
last appearances of M. Drouet at Varennes.</p>

<p>His post-house was situated on one of the short cuts to
the frontier; and by the road many nobles had emigrated,
as if to point out the proper route for the King.</p>

<p>A new event had taken place, which had appeared to
M. Drouet of sufficient importance to warrant a consultation
with his friends.</p>

<p>This was the event I speak of.</p>

<p>On the 20th of June, in the morning, a detachment of
hussars, with brown dolmans (some said that they were a
part of De Lauzun’s regiment, others that they were a part
of Esterhazy’s), had entered St. Menehould by the Clermont
road.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125"></a>[125]</span></p>

<p>At that time, when the troops were billeted on the
tradespeople, the authorities were generally informed of
their arrival two or three days in advance.</p>

<p>In this case, the authorities had received no advice.</p>

<p>M. Drouet had spoken to the officer commanding the
detachment. This officer, whom he remembered to have
seen two months before passing between St. Menehould,
Châlons, and Varennes, was called M. Goguelot.</p>

<p>Recognised by M. Drouet, this officer had no hesitation
in chatting with him. He said he had been sent with his
forty men to form an escort for a treasure.</p>

<p>While M. Jean Baptiste was talking with him, a messenger
arrived from the municipality, asking the reason of his
coming unannounced and unexpected.</p>

<p>“Don’t trouble yourself about nothing,” replied the
officer; “myself and my men will sleep here; but as we
set off in a hurry on a particular service, we are utterly
without rations. We will pay all our expenses, so as not
to be a burden on the tradespeople. To-morrow, at daybreak,
we start for Pont-de-Somme-Vesles.”</p>

<p>The messenger took this response to the authorities; but
they, not being satisfied with it, sent him back with a
request that M. Goguelot would step up to the Mayor’s
house.</p>

<p>He accordingly went there, M. Drouet following.</p>

<p>When asked the reason of his march, the officer exhibited
an order from M. de Bouillé, commanding him to be at
Pont-de-Somme-Vesles on the 21st of June, to take charge
of, and escort some treasure which was there, to St. Menehould,
where he was to surrender his trust to Colonel Dandoin,
of the First Regiment of Dragoons.</p>

<p>They then asked where were M. Dandoin’s dragoons.</p>

<p>“He follows me,” he replied; “and will arrive here to-morrow
morning.”</p>

<p>The interrogatory was not pushed any farther; but
M. Drouet was not satisfied, so he had run over to Varennes,
to inform his companions of the event, and to hold a
consultation with them.</p>

<p>Just as he had finished his tale, the younger brother
Leblanc entered.</p>

<p>He had come from Stenay.</p>

<p>“Do you wish to see some beautiful horses, M. Jean
Baptiste?” asked he.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126"></a>[126]</span></p>

<p>“I should like nothing better,” replied Drouet, “especially
if they are for sale, as I want a remount.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think that they are for sale; but what is astonishing
is that they are harnessed in relays.”</p>

<p>“Where are they?”</p>

<p>“At the ‘Grand Monarque,’ with Father Gautier.”</p>

<p>M. Jean Baptiste looked at us.</p>

<p>“It is well, Victor,” he said; “I will go there after dinner.
Have you any other news?”</p>

<p>“No; there is a movement going on among the troops at
Stenay, but there is nothing astonishing in that. I should
not be surprised if we received an announcement of their
arrival here to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“Nor I,” said Drouet.</p>

<p>We finished dinner, and entered into the <span lang="fr">Rue de la Basse
Cour</span>, crossed the bridge, and arrived at the “Grand Monarque,”
where we found six horses being carefully attended
to by the two grooms.</p>

<p>“Those are fine horses. Whose are they, my friend?”</p>

<p>“My master’s!” insolently replied one of the grooms.</p>

<p>“The name of your master is a secret, I suppose?”
queried M. Drouet.</p>

<p>“That depends upon who asks me.”</p>

<p>M. Guillaume frowned.</p>

<p>“This is an insolent scoundrel,” said he, “who merits
being taught how lackeys should speak to men!”</p>

<p>“Will you teach me?” asked the groom.</p>

<p>“Why not?” asked Guillaume, going a step nearer to
him.</p>

<p>M. Jean Baptiste stopped him by taking hold of his arm.</p>

<p>“My dear Guillaume,” said he, “don’t put yourself out;
perhaps this good man is forbidden to speak, and has come
like M. Goguelot, for the treasure.”</p>

<p>“Do you know M. Goguelot, and why we are here?”</p>

<p>“You are here for the treasure which the hussars are
bringing from Pont-de-Somme-Vesles, to hand over to the
dragoons who were awaiting them at St. Menehould.”</p>

<p>“If you are one of us, monsieur,” said the groom, touching
his hat, “I have no reason to refuse telling you to whom
the horses belong. They are the property of the Duke of
Choiseul.”</p>

<p>“You have said well,” said Drouet, laughing; “and we
were going to quarrel with one of our friends.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127"></a>[127]</span></p>

<p>“If you are a friend, monsieur, you might tell me whom
you are, as I have told you about the horses?”</p>

<p>“You are right. I have no motive for concealing my
name. I am Jean Baptiste Drouet, postmaster at St. Menehould.”</p>

<p>“As you have said, you are <em>probably</em> one of us.”</p>

<p>At this moment, Father Gautier stepped out from the
kitchen door.</p>

<p>M. Drouet thought he had better say no more to the
groom, for fear of exciting suspicion.</p>

<p>“Ah, ha! Father Gautier,” said he; “your kitchen
appears to be in full blow.”</p>

<p>The fires in fact, were at their highest.</p>

<p>“It is so, M. Drouet; but the astonishing part of it is,
that I do not know for whom the cooking is going on.”</p>

<p>“You don’t know for whom?”</p>

<p>“No. I received on the 14th, an order from the military
commandant to prepare a dinner for five o’clock, and it is
now the 24th, and no one has arrived to eat it; but as it is
a written command, I am not afraid, for eaten or not, the
dinners are always paid for.”</p>

<p>M. Drouet again looked at us.</p>

<p>“Perhaps they are some great lords about to emigrate,”
said M. Jean Baptiste.</p>

<p>“And who take away our money,” replied Father Gautier.</p>

<p>“In any case, they will leave you a little of theirs. Six
or eight dinners, at how much a head?”</p>

<p>“Three crowns, not including the wine.”</p>

<p>“And for how many people?”</p>

<p>“Eight or ten; the number was not definitely arranged.”</p>

<p>“Father Gautier,” said M. Drouet, “you will yet die
rich.”</p>

<p>He then shook hands with him, smiling.</p>

<p>We left the house, and soon found ourselves in the street.</p>

<p>“My friend,” said M. Drouet, “without doubt, something
extraordinary is about to take place. I shall return to
Saint Menehould without losing a moment. Guillaume
will go with me. When you get home, watch day and
night. Sleep with one eye open, and hold yourselves in
readiness for whatever may happen.”</p>

<p>We returned quickly to the “Bras d’Or;” M. Drouet<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128"></a>[128]</span>
saddled his horse with his own hands. M. Guillaume borrowed
one of the elder of the Leblancs, and they both set
off for St. Menehould at a sharp trot, recommending us
both to keep our eyes and ears well open.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXIV">CHAPTER XXIV.<br>
<span class="fs70">THE NIGHT OF THE 21ST OF AUGUST, 1791.</span></h2>


<p>One can easily understand that it was late when we
sought our respective couches, and that we rose early the
next morning, having kept one eye open all the time that
we slept.</p>

<p>When I say we, of course I speak of M. Billaud and the
elder Leblanc, whom M. Drouet had taken into his confidence.</p>

<p>About eleven in the morning we heard that a detachment
of hussars had been seen on the road from Stenay.</p>

<p>I left my work, giving a few words of explanation to
M. Gerbaut and Mdlle. Sophie. They partook of the general
agitation which pervaded the town, or rather the air
which seemed tremendous with coming events.</p>

<p>Mdlle. Sophie was very much excited, especially when I
announced the approach of the hussars. Two days previously,
MM. Malmy and Courtemont had arrived at Varennes.</p>

<p>I crossed the bridge and entered the Grand Place on one
side, at the same moment as the hussars entered it at the
other.</p>

<p>They stopped a moment on the Place, spoke to the groom,
who had arrived the evening before with the relays, which,
by superior orders, they had stabled in the old Convent of
the Cordeliers.</p>

<p>They were commanded by a tall officer of effeminate
appearance, and blonde complexion. He spoke French with
a very strong German accent. His name was M. de Rokrey.</p>

<p>He put up in the Place, not at an hotel, but with a
tradesman of the town, to whom he bore a letter of recommendation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129"></a>[129]</span></p>

<p>Behind me a great number of the inhabitants of the
High Town were descending and forming themselves in
groups with those of the Low Town.</p>

<p>About one o’clock, two young officers arrived by the
same route, and stopped to speak with him who commanded
the detachment.</p>

<p>One of them approached me, and asked if I knew the
whereabouts of Neuvilly.</p>

<p>I told him it was half-way between Clermont and
Varennes, and pointed out the direction to take.</p>

<p>“Can you tell me, sir,” said he, “the cause of the agitation
of the people?”</p>

<p>“The movements of the troops about the city for the
last two days. It is reported that they are to form a convoy
for a treasure, and the inhabitants are curious.”</p>

<p>The two officers looked at each other.</p>

<p>“Can one get to Neuvilly,” asked one of the two, “without
passing through the town?”</p>

<p>“Impossible!” replied I. “A canal of great width intersects
the road; and even if your horses could swim
across they would not be able to mount the opposite bank.”</p>

<p>The officer turned round to his friend.</p>

<p>“What will you do? It appears that the relays must
pass through the town.”</p>

<p>“We have plenty of time,” replied his friend; “the
courier will precede the carriage two hours.”</p>

<p>The two officers thanked me for my information, and proceeded
to the “<span lang="fr">Hotel du Grand Monarque</span>,” in the court of
which they dismounted, having thrown the bridles of their
horses to the stable boys in attendance.</p>

<p>It was evident that the persons expected would arrive
from the opposite side of the city—that is to say, the side
on which Paris lies.</p>

<p>It was, therefore, but lost time to stay in the Low Town.</p>

<p>I walked up to the High Town, crossed the bridge, and
returned to M. Gerbaut’s just as they were sitting down to
dinner. Notwithstanding the stifling heat, the Place de
Latry was crowded.</p>

<p>During dinner, Father Gerbaut lost himself in vain conjectures
as to what was going on. Sophie, on the contrary,
said not a word, scarcely lifted her eyes from her plate, and
ate little or nothing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130"></a>[130]</span></p>

<p>Not being authorized by M. Drouet to tell what I knew,
I also held my peace.</p>

<p>In the meantime, in order that the reader may fully understand
what was about to take place, it is necessary for
me to describe the scene of action.</p>

<p>Varennes, as I before told you, is divided into two parts,
the High Town and the Low Town. The High Town was
called the Château.</p>

<p>On coming from Clermont, you enter Varennes by a
straight road, which, for more than two leagues, has not a
single curve in it, with the exception of where it enters
Neuvilly.</p>

<p>All of a sudden as you approach those scattered houses
which always foretell a city, the road takes a sudden turn
to the right, and falls, as it were, into the midst of the city
by the <span lang="fr">Rue des Réligieuses</span>.</p>

<p>This descent ends at the <span lang="fr">Place de Latry</span>.</p>

<p>That Place is, or rather was at the time of which I am
writing, entirely blocked for two-thirds of its length by the
Church of St. Gengoulf, the side of which touched the
right side of the Place (I speak of the right side with reference
to Paris), and the façades of which overlooked a
cemetery, which, stretching from the side of the Rue de
l’Horloge, left a passage of about thirty yards open to the
sky.</p>

<p>Another passage, intended for carriages, was formed, but
on account of an arch stretching over it, it was impossible
for vehicles loaded too high to pass underneath.</p>

<p>Emerging from under that arch, one stood facing, five or
six paces off, the <span lang="fr">Rue de la Basse Cour</span>. On entering, you
could see on the right of him the “<span lang="fr">Hotel du Bras d’Or</span>.”</p>

<p>A little further on to the left stood the house of
M. Sauce, <span lang="fr">Procureur de la Commune</span>.</p>

<p>I have already said that his house was only separated
from M. Gerbaut’s by a passage.</p>

<p>The <span lang="fr">Rue de la Basse Cour</span> descends rapidly to a little
Place, where it joins the <span lang="fr">Rue Neuve</span> and the <span lang="fr">Rue St. John</span>.</p>

<p>A little running stream of rather deep but clear water,
over a pebbly bottom, intersects the Place. A bridge, narrower
than the one you would find there to-day, joins the
two parts of the town—that is to say, the High and Low
Town. The bridge crossed, and the corner of the “Grand
Monarque” rounded, you find yourself in the Grand Place.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131"></a>[131]</span></p>

<p>It was on that Place that the hussars were stationed
before they took up their lodgings in the old Convent of
the Cordeliers, and it was at the “Grand Monarque,”
which bore the effigy of Louis XVI, that the relays stopped;
also the two officers, whom I have since discovered
were M. de Bouillé, the younger, and M. de Raigecourt;
and where, for eight days, they had prepared dinner for an
imaginary traveller who was always expected, and who
never came.</p>

<p>This being all explained, the reader will be able the
better to understand the various scenes of the drama, which
will, in due time, be laid before him.</p>

<p>Tired of seeing nothing fresh, though the day had been
passed in excitement, at the moment the clock struck eight
I quitted the house of M. Gerbaut. My intention was to
walk along the road leading to Neuvilly, and if I saw
nothing, to return home, go to bed, and patiently await the
morrow.</p>

<p>Many houses had their windows open, and were lighted
up.</p>

<p>The “<span lang="fr">Hotel du Bras d’Or</span>” was one of these.</p>

<p>Some young townsmen were playing at billiards on the
first floor. They were MM. Coquilard, Justin, Georges,
and Soucin. Two travellers staying at the hotel by chance
were playing with them. These were M. Thevenin, of
Islettes, and M. Delion, of Montfaucon.</p>

<p>I passed under the arch, and entered the Place; two or
three houses alone were lighted up.</p>

<p>The crowd had dispersed; not a light was burning in the
<span lang="fr">Rue des Réligieuses</span>, with the exception of two lanterns,
which only made the darkness in the street visible.</p>

<p>I walked up the street, and stopped on the summit,
whence I could see the whole town.</p>

<p>All seemed to sleep. The Low Town betrayed, especially
on the Place, no more life.</p>

<p>I saw torches waving in the direction of the “Grand
Monarque.”</p>

<p>I was occupied in watching them, when I fancied that I
heard the gallop of a horse.</p>

<p>I laid myself down with my ear to the ground.</p>

<p>The noise was now more distinct, on account, no doubt,
of the horse having passed from the earth on to the stones.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132"></a>[132]</span></p>

<p>I jumped up, convinced that a horseman was approaching.</p>

<p>And not only that, I fancied that I heard in the distance
the rumble of the wheels of a carriage.</p>

<p>The event expected all day, and watched for by night,
was about to happen.</p>

<p>I hid myself in the angle of the wall.</p>

<p>The gallop approached rapidly.</p>

<p>Presently I distinguished, in the midst of the road, a
horseman.</p>

<p>When the straggling houses came in view, the horseman
stopped indecisively.</p>

<p>It was evident that he knew not whether to stop or continue
his route.</p>

<p>For the moment, I thought of showing myself, and offering
to guide them; but, on second thoughts, I considered
it the least likely mode by which to gain information.</p>

<p>I therefore stayed where I was, doubly hidden by the
night and the wall.</p>

<p>The horseman dismounted, passed the bridle of his
horse over his arm, and walked on a few paces, knocking at
the doors of the different houses to see if they would open.</p>

<p>At last he knocked at No. 4. That opened.</p>

<p>It was the property of a small householder, called Jourdan.</p>

<p>“Who are you, and what do you want?” asked a voice.</p>

<p>“Pardon, monsieur,” returned the courier: “but is this
Varennes?”</p>

<p>“Did you wake me up to ask me such a question as that?
You are laughing at me!”</p>

<p>“Excuse me, monsieur, but I am a stranger here, and
wish to know if I have really arrived at Varennes.”</p>

<p>“You have, monsieur. If you have come for beds, find
them, and leave me to my sleep. Good night!”</p>

<p>“Your pardon, monsieur,” said the courier; “I came
not here to sleep, but am in advance of a carriage which expects
relays at Varennes.”</p>

<p>“I am sorry for you; but it is no use expecting relays at
Varennes, for we do not possess a post-house.”</p>

<p>“I know that, monsieur.”</p>

<p>“Why did you ask me, then?”</p>

<p>A woman’s voice was heard.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133"></a>[133]</span></p>

<p>“Come to bed, Martin,” said she. “You ought to see
that he is only making fun of you.”</p>

<p>“You hear—my wife calls me!”</p>

<p>He tried to close the door, but the unknown stopped him
by placing his arm in the aperture.</p>

<p>“Ha, monsieur!” said the tradesman; “what does this
mean? Do you wish to do me an injury?”</p>

<p>“Do not be frightened; I only wish to ask you a question.”</p>

<p>“You have asked me ten already.”</p>

<p>“I know that I am at Varennes, thanks to you; I know
that there is no post-house, but I knew that before. Having
been so kind as to answer those questions, perhaps you
will not object to one more?”</p>

<p>“How? Did not you tell me that you were preceding a
carriage to Varennes?”</p>

<p>“No doubt; but you have not allowed me to continue.
A relay ought to be ready opposite the first houses of Neuvilly;
I wished to ask—have you seen that relay?”</p>

<p>“Oh, that is another thing; you should have begun to
speak in that manner!”</p>

<p>“Have you seen them?”</p>

<p>“The relay?”</p>

<p>“Yes, the relay.”</p>

<p>“No, monsieur, I have not.”</p>

<p>“You must tell me all that you know, at once,” cried the
impatient courier.</p>

<p>“I have told you about the relay, but you did not ask
me till just now.”</p>

<p>The same woman’s voice was again heard, crying out
afresh. “Make him go, husband,” she said; “he is only
making a fool of you—he is doing it for a wager.”</p>

<p>“You hear, sir,” said the man; “my wife says you are
doing it for a wager.”</p>

<p>“Nothing of the kind, I assure you, monsieur. Thank
you for your information; you can now shut your door, and
reseek your wife.”</p>

<p>The tradesman slammed his door in a rage.</p>

<p>“Shall I wait here?” soliloquised the unknown.</p>

<p>He was not long kept waiting. During the dialogue on
the door-step, the carriage was rapidly drawing nigh; not
only did he hear the wheels, but the neighing of the
horses.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134"></a>[134]</span></p>

<p>The courier, placing himself in the midst of the road,
awaited its arrival.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXV">CHAPTER XXV.<br>
<span class="fs70">THE TRAGEDY OF ROYALTY BEGINS.</span></h2>


<p>Scarcely five minutes had passed, when I began to distinguish
a black phantom; and soon after I saw the sparks
flying from under the horses’ hoofs.</p>

<p>As the mass approached, I saw that it was composed of
two carriages.</p>

<p>The first was an ordinary cabriolet; the second, an immense
travelling carriage.</p>

<p>On seeing the road blocked by one man, on foot, holding
a horse by the bridle, the postilion cracked his whip, and
shouted to the horses to go on.</p>

<p>But the unknown, in an imperative voice, cried out
“Stop!” lifting his hand at the same time. “I wish to
speak to the travellers in the second carriage!”</p>

<p>“Oh, Valory!” cried a voice from the first; “is anything
wrong?”</p>

<p>“No, madame; only a slight mistake.”</p>

<p>Then approaching the second carriage, “Pardon,” said
he; “we have arrived at Varennes, and there is no relay.”</p>

<p>“How!—no relay? What is the reason of it?” replied
a female voice.</p>

<p>“I know not; but I am very nervous about it.”</p>

<p>“Wake up, monsieur,” said the same voice, with an impatient
gesture. “Do you not hear what M. Valory
says?”</p>

<p>“What does he say?” replied a masculine voice.</p>

<p>“He says that we are at Varennes, and that there
are no relays.”</p>

<p>“Has he asked?”</p>

<p>“For a quarter of an hour I knocked; for another
quarter, I talked, I asked, and commanded fruitlessly.”</p>

<p>“Let us get out,” said the masculine voice, “and take
a look about for ourselves.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135"></a>[135]</span></p>

<p>The door opened.</p>

<p>“No,” said the female voice; “let me get down; I will
manage it,”—and she leaped nimbly to the earth.</p>

<p>“Madame—madame!” said the voice of a child; “let
me get out with you.”</p>

<p>“No, Louis,” said the lady; “stay in the carriage with
your papa; I shall come back in a moment. Give me your
arm, M. de Valory.”</p>

<p>The courier approached, respectfully, his hat in his hand,
and offered his arm to the lady who asked it.</p>

<p>“Here,” said she; “just here is a door opening.”</p>

<p>But as she spoke the words, though in the slightest degree
open, it was shut again.</p>

<p>M. de Valory jumped forward, and, at the risk of cutting
his hand, seized the door on his side, and pulled it violently
backward.</p>

<p>The door yielded to the force used, and showed a man of
fifty or fifty-five years, holding a candle in his hand. He
was attired in a dressing-gown, and had his naked feet
thrust into slippers.</p>

<p>This was the same M. Préfontaine whom I have already
spoken of, and with whom M. Dampierre stayed when he
came to Varennes.</p>

<p>“What do you want, Monsieur?” asked the astonished
old Chevalier; “and why do you break open my door?”</p>

<p>“Monsieur,” replied the courier, “we do not know Varennes;
we are <i lang="fr">en route</i> for Stenay. Will you be kind
enough to point out the road we ought to follow?”</p>

<p>“If I render you this service, perhaps I shall be compromised!”</p>

<p>“You, I am sure, will never refuse to render a service to
a lady who is in danger.”</p>

<p>“Monsieur,” said the old gentleman, “the lady who is
behind you is not simply a woman.” Then lowering his
voice, he said, “It is the Queen!”</p>

<p>M. de Valory tried to deny it; but the Queen, taking him
by the arm, “Lose no time in discussion,” she said; “tell
the King alone that we are discovered.”</p>

<p>At this moment, two other young gentlemen, dressed as
couriers, jumped down from the box of the chaise.</p>

<p>“Sire,” said M. Valory, “the Queen desires me to tell
you that she is recognised.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136"></a>[136]</span></p>

<p>“By whom?” asked the King.</p>

<p>“By an old man, of courteous manners, who, though a
little timid, has the air of a gentleman.”</p>

<p>“Ask him to come and speak to me,” said the King.</p>

<p>M. Valory transmitted the invitation to the gentleman.</p>

<p>He went to the carriage, showing signs of great apprehension.</p>

<p>The Queen followed him; her face, made visible by the
light of the candle which he held, expressed supreme disdain.</p>

<p>“Your name, sir?” asked the King.</p>

<p>“De Préfontaine,” replied the interrogated, hesitatingly.</p>

<p>“Who are you?”</p>

<p>“Major of cavalry, sire, and Chevalier of the Military
Order of St. Louis.”</p>

<p>“In your double capacity as major of cavalry, and
Chevalier of the Order of St. Louis, you have twice sworn
fealty to your King. It is, therefore, your duty to aid me
in the difficulty in which I find myself.”</p>

<p>The Major murmured some words; the Queen stamped
her foot with impatience.</p>

<p>“Ah, sire!” said she; “see you not that the Major is
afraid.”</p>

<p>The King looked as if he had not heard her remark.</p>

<p>“Monsieur,” continued he, “have you heard that a
detachment of hussars, and relays of horses, await a
treasure which must pass through Varennes?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sire,” replied M. de Préfontaine.</p>

<p>“Where are the hussars? Where are the horses?”</p>

<p>“In the Low Town, sire.”</p>

<p>“And the officers?”</p>

<p>“At the ‘<span lang="fr">Hotel du Grand Monarque</span>.’”</p>

<p>“Monsieur, I thank you,” said the King. “You can
return to your house; no one has seen you—no one has
heard you; therefore, no harm can happen to you.”</p>

<p>The Major took the hint, and retired, after having made
a profound obeisance.</p>

<p>“Messieurs,” said the King, addressing the two young
gentlemen who had dismounted from the box-seat, “take
your places. You, M. de Valory, jump on your horse, and
gallop on to the ‘Grand Monarque.’ You hear that our
escort is there.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137"></a>[137]</span></p>

<p>The two young gentlemen took their places, and
M. de Valory vaulted into his saddle.</p>

<p>The King and Queen re-entered the carriage, the door
of which was shut by one of the postilions.</p>

<p>“Postilions!” cried all three gentlemen, with one voice,
“to the ‘<span lang="fr">Hotel du Grand Monarque</span>.’”</p>

<p>The men whipped up their horses; but at the same
instant, a man, covered with dust, on a horse flecked with
foam, seemed to spring from the ground, and rushing diagonally
across the road, cried out, in a voice of thunder,
“Stop, postilions! You drive the King!”</p>

<p>I uttered a cry of astonishment, for I recognized the
voice of M. Drouet.</p>

<p>The postilions who had hitherto been lashing their
horses, stopped, as if stricken by a cannon-shot.</p>

<p>The Queen felt, without doubt, that it was a moment for
decisive action.</p>

<p>“Order them! Command them!” she cried, to the
King.</p>

<p>The King put his head out of the carriage window.</p>

<p>“Who are you, sir,” said he, “that you dare to give
orders here?”</p>

<p>“A simple citizen, sire,” replied M. Drouet; “but,”
continued he, raising himself in his stirrups, and stretching
out his arm, “I speak in the name of the nation and
of the law. Postilions! not a step farther, on your lives!”</p>

<p>“Postilions!” cried the King, “to the ‘Grand Monarque!’
It is I who command you!”</p>

<p>“To the ‘Grand Monarque!’” cried the three gentlemen.</p>

<p>“Postilions!” cried M. Drouet, “you know me well,
and are accustomed to obey me. I am Jean Baptiste
Drouet, postmaster at St. Menehould.”</p>

<p>M. de Valory saw the indecision of the postilions—ten
men stopped by one. He saw that it was necessary to slay
that one, and, drawing his <i lang="fr">couteau de chasse</i>, he went at
him.</p>

<p>In a moment, I jumped out of my hiding-place, and
seized the bridle of his horse.</p>

<p>The horse, being frightened, reared, and threw its rider.</p>

<p>M. Drouet recognised me.</p>

<p>“Ah! is it you Réné?” he exclaimed. “Follow me!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138"></a>[138]</span></p>

<p>Sticking his spurs into his horse, he seemed to sink into
the ground, so quickly did he disappear down the declivity
of the <span lang="fr">Rue des Réligieuses</span>.</p>

<p>“Here I am! Here I am, M. Drouet!” cried I, following
quickly behind him.</p>

<p>M. Drouet dashed down the <span lang="fr">Rue des Réligieuses</span>, crossed,
like a flash of lightning the Place Latry, plunged under
the arch, and reappeared in a moment on the other side, in
front of the “Hotel Bras d’Or,” running up against another
cavalier as he did so.</p>

<p>“Is it thou, Drouet?” said the cavalier.</p>

<p>“Is it thou, Guillaume?” cried Drouet.</p>

<p>“Yes!” “Yes!” each replied simultaneously.</p>

<p>Both dismounted, that they might pass under the
entrance of the inn.</p>

<p>In the meantime, the billiard-players, hearing a noise,
rushed to the window, to see what it meant.</p>

<p>“Be on your guard!” cried M. Drouet. “The King,
with his family, are trying to escape! They are travelling
in two carriages. Wake up M. Sauce!—cry ‘Fire! fire!’
Guillaume and I will guard the bridge.”</p>

<p>At this moment, I arrived, and dashed against the door
of the <span lang="fr">Procureur de la Commune</span>, crying as loud as I could,
“Fire! fire!” as M. Drouet had recommended.</p>

<p>In the meantime, he and Guillaume had disappeared
down the Rue Neuve.</p>

<p>At the end of the bridge, they encountered a cart
filled with furniture.</p>

<p>“Whose cart is that?” cried M. Drouet.</p>

<p>“Mine,” replied the driver.</p>

<p>“Ah, is it yours, Regnier?” said Guillaume. “You, I
know, are a good patriot. Turn your cart across the
bridge; it will stop the passage of the king.”</p>

<p>“The King?”</p>

<p>“Yes; the King. He wishes to get to the Place of the
‘Grand Monarque,’ where the hussars await him.”</p>

<p>“I have seen them,” said Guillaume.</p>

<p>“And I also,” said Regnier.</p>

<p>“Now to work,” said the two young men.</p>

<p>“Yes; to work!” replied the proprietor of the furniture.</p>

<p>And all three with their united efforts, managed to upset
the cart across the bridge.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139"></a>[139]</span></p>

<p>When the operation was finished, they listened.</p>

<p>They heard the rumble of the carriages, which descended
the <span lang="fr">Rue des Réligieuses</span> at full speed, at the same time the
cry of “Fire! fire!” burst upon their ears.</p>

<p>I will now tell you what occurred on the high road,
after M. Drouet and I left the two carriages, as well as
I can from the description given me afterwards by M. de
Préfontaine, who, though he had closed his door, took good
care to open his window, and, therefore, saw and heard all
that passed.</p>

<p>M. de Valory, when he fell, did not abandon his hold on
the bridle of his horse, and as he tumbled on soft ground,
he escaped with a few bruises.</p>

<p>He was, therefore, soon again mounted, and, threatening
the postilions with his raised whip, he cried, “Well,
wretches, have you understood?”</p>

<p>“Certainly; and have you?”</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“That which M. Drouet said. He told us not to go any
farther.”</p>

<p>“You dare to quote M. Drouet, when the King commands!”</p>

<p>“Get rid of the three scoundrels!” said one of the
young gentlemen on the box, “and let us drive the carriage
ourselves.”</p>

<p>“Gentlemen!” cried the Queen, who saw that there was
going to be bloodshed.</p>

<p>Then to the postilions—“Gentlemen,” she said, in her
softest voice, “I do not order, I entreat. Fifty louis to each
one of you, if you drive us safely to the ‘Grand Monarque.’”</p>

<p>Frightened of the swords of the gentlemen, and melted
by the entreaty of the Queen, the postilions set off at a
gallop.</p>

<p>But they had lost ten minutes, and these ten minutes
M. Drouet had turned to profit.</p>

<p>They dashed on, but were obliged to avoid the arch, for
fear of breaking their heads, so they turned round the
church, and began to descend the Rue Basse Cour.</p>

<p>But before they could execute that manœuvre, their
course was suddenly arrested.</p>

<p>The cabriolet, as we have said, preceded the chaise; but<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140"></a>[140]</span>
scarcely had it turned out of the Place, when the bridles of
the horses were seized by two men. These were the elder
Leblanc, and M. Thevenin, of Islettes.</p>

<p>That first carriage contained but two maids of honor to
the Queen—Mesdames Brunier and De Neuville.</p>

<p>“Messieurs! messieurs!” cried they; “what is your
will?”</p>

<p>At this moment, a man advanced towards the cabriolet.
He was the <span lang="fr">Procureur de la Commune</span>, M. Sauce, who,
awakened from his sleep had sallied out, determined to do
his duty.</p>

<p>“Excuse me, ladies,” said he, “but, without doubt, you
have passports?”</p>

<p>“They are with the people in the other carriage,”
replied Madame de Neuville.</p>

<p>The cabriolet having stopped, the chaise was forced to do
likewise; thus it was completely blockaded. MM. Drouet,
Guillaume, and Regnier, having finished barricading
the bridge, rushed to the spot. There were four persons,
armed with guns—namely, our four billiard-players, Coquillard,
Justin, Soucin, and Delion; a fifth had arrived—namely,
Billaud, who had heard the noise; and a sixth,
M. Bellay, opened his door, and seemed not less ardent than
the others.</p>

<p>All at once, I felt my arm grasped by a trembling hand,
and the voice of Sophie whispered in my ear “For the
love of me, Réné, do not meddle in this matter!”</p>

<p>If M. Drouet had required my assistance, I am afraid
that he would have triumphed over Sophie; but he did not,
as he was incurring no present danger; so I stood silent,
motionless at the corner of the street, with Sophie on my
arm.</p>

<p>M. Gerbaut’s window opened, and we heard him ask
what was the matter.</p>

<p>All the windows and doors in the street opened one after
the other, the cries of “Fire! fire!” having alarmed all,
and made them anxious to see what was the matter.</p>

<p>During this time, M. Sauce had been approaching the
chaise; and as if he knew not who the travellers were—“Who
are you?”</p>

<p>“I am the Baroness de Korff,” replied Madame de
Tourzel, governess of the Dauphin.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141"></a>[141]</span></p>

<p>“Where are you going?”</p>

<p>“To Frankfort, with my two children, my two sisters, my
steward, and my two female attendants. The latter are in
the first carriage.”</p>

<p>“Madame,” said Sauce, “you are going the wrong way
to Frankfort—but that is not the question. Have you a
passport?”</p>

<p>Madame de Tourzel drew the passport from her pocket,
and presented it to the <span lang="fr">Procureur de la Commune</span>.</p>

<p>The passport was correct. It was, in fact, that of
Madame de Korff, which M. de Fersen had given to the
Queen.</p>

<p>M. Sauce took the passport, which the false Baroness
handed him; and, by the light of a lantern which an officious
bystander offered him, began to reconnoitre the King.</p>

<p>The king, no doubt, wounded by the mark of disrespect,
tried to make some resistance.</p>

<p>“Who are you, sir?” asked he of the magistrate.
“What is your rank? Are you only a National Guard?”</p>

<p>“I am <span lang="fr">Procureur de la Commune</span>,” replied M. Sauce.</p>

<p>The King, whether dumbfounded by the force of these
words, or conceiving that the response was sufficient, made
no further objections.</p>

<p>The procureur threw his eyes over the passport, and
addressing, not the King, but the false Baroness de Korff,—“Madame,”
said he, “it is too late to <i lang="fr">viser</i> a passport to-night;
and, on the other hand, it is my duty to detain
you!”</p>

<p>The Queen interposed.</p>

<p>“Why so, sir?” she demanded in an imperative manner.</p>

<p>“Because, did I permit you to continue your route, I
should be running a risk, on account of the reports that are
flying about.”</p>

<p>“Pray, sir, to what reports do you allude?”</p>

<p>“The report of the flight of the King and his family,”
replied Sauce, fixedly regarding the King.</p>

<p>The travellers were aghast. The Queen drew back into
the shadow of the carriage.</p>

<p>All this time, the passport was being examined, in a public
room in the “Grand Monarque,” by the light of two
candles. A member of the council remarked that the passport
was correct, since it had been signed by the King and
the Minister for Foreign Affairs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142"></a>[142]</span></p>

<p>“Yes,” remarked Drouet, who had arrived with Guillaume
and Regnier during the discussion, “but it is not
signed by the President of the National Assembly!”</p>

<p>“How?” said a voice. “Why should it be signed by
him?”</p>

<p>“Certainly, it should be,” said Drouet, “considering that
France is a nation—considering that it has appointed deputies
to maintain its rights. The true King of France is he
who sat on a seat as lofty as the King’s at the Champ de
Mars—not only the veritable, but the more than King!”</p>

<p>All were silent. No one could oppose such logic as that.
That great social question, which had disturbed France for
seven hundred years,—“Is there in France an authority
superior to the King’s?” was settled in the public room of
an inn in a little town on the borders of the Forest of
Argonne.</p>

<p>Drouet walked straight to the carriage. In all popular
movements he took the lead, and, therefore, the responsibility.</p>

<p>“Madame,” said he, addressing the Queen, and not
Madame Tourzel, “if you are really Madame de Korff—that
is to say, a Swiss, and consequently a stranger—how
is it that you have sufficient influence to command a
military escort consisting of a detachment of dragoons at
St. Menehould, and another at Clermont; also a first
detachment of hussars at Pont-de-Somme-Vesles, and a
second at Varennes?”</p>

<p>To end a fatiguing discussion, and one in which M.
Drouet feared that the Procureur, an honest man enough,
but not equal to any great situation, would eventually
yield, he put his hand into the carriage as a support for the
Queen, and said, “Will you be so kind, madame, as to
descend?”</p>

<p>To tell the truth, the Procureur was most dreadfully
embarrassed.</p>

<p>Encouraged by M. Drouet’s invitation to the Queen, and
hearing the tocsin begin to ring, he, however, approached
the door—from which he had been turned to make place
for M. Drouet—with great humility, his hat in his hand.</p>

<p>“The Municipal Council is deliberating,” said he,
“whether it would be advisable to allow you to continue
your route; but a report, wrong or otherwise, has been<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143"></a>[143]</span>
spread about that it is the King and his august family
whom we have the honor of receiving in our walls. I beg
you, therefore, to accept the shelter of my house, in all
amity, until such time as the council shall have finished
their deliberation. Against our will the tocsin has been
sounded. The concourse of the inhabitants of the city is
increased by the entry of the country people; and, perhaps,
the King—if, in truth, I have the honor of addressing a
King—may be exposed to insults which we should be
unable to prevent, and which would fill us with unmitigated
grief!”</p>

<p>It was no use his resisting. The Low Town was evidently
ignorant of what was passing in the High Town.
No succor arrived, or, indeed, appeared likely to arrive.
The three young gentlemen dressed as couriers had no
other arms than their <i lang="fr">couteaux de chasse</i>, and could not
undertake to fight with thirty men armed with guns. The
tocsin still vibrated in the air, and found an echo in every
heart.</p>

<p>The King set the example, and alighted.</p>

<p>I then had a good view of him, and my astonishment at
seeing a king in such a costume was great.</p>

<p>He wore a drab gray coat, a satin waistcoat, and a pair
of gray trousers, gray stockings, shoes with buckles, and a
three-cornered hat.</p>

<p>In descending, he knocked his head against the top of
the door, and his hat fell off. His hair was in tresses on
the top of his head, and was fixed there with an ivory
comb.</p>

<p>In a word, his costume corresponded with the title of a
steward, which he bore in the passport of Madame Korff.</p>

<p>I picked up the hat, and handed it to him.</p>

<p>The Queen descended next, and after her, Madame Royale
and the Dauphin, who was disguised as a little girl;
then came Madame Elizabeth, and, last, Madame de Tourzel.</p>

<p>Sauce had opened wide the door of his shop, and passed
all sorts of compliments on the King whom he persisted in
calling “your Majesty,” though the King equally persisted
that his name was M. Durand.</p>

<p>The Queen had not the courage to support this humiliating
assumption.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144"></a>[144]</span></p>

<p>“Well, then,” said she, “if monsieur is your King, and
I your Queen, treat us with the respect that our rank
demands.”</p>

<p>At these words, the King was ashamed, and said, “Very
well, I am your King; there is your Queen, and there are
our children.”</p>

<p>Though vulgar enough in his royal dress, the King lost
altogether what little dignity he had under the costume of
a steward.</p>

<p>Besides, always unfortunate, a grocer’s shop, with its surroundings,
was not the most romantic spot in which to utter
those royal words:—</p>

<p>“Placed in the capital, in the midst of swords and bayonets,
I came to seek in the country, in the midst of my
faithful subjects, the liberty and peace that were denied me
in Paris.”</p>

<p>Then, opening his arms, he pressed poor M. Sauce, paralyzed
with the honor, to his breast.</p>

<p>At the moment that the King embraced M. Sauce, a
thunder of horses’ hoofs was heard coming in an unexpected
direction—that is to say, from the Place Latry.</p>

<p>The King believed that it was assistance, but the patriots
smelt danger; and M. Drouet cried out, “Take the King
up to the first floor!”</p>

<p>Sauce asked the King to follow him, and he did so, without
making any difficulty.</p>

<p>Scarcely was the door of the chamber on the ground floor
shut, when they heard a tumult at the head of the Rue de
la Basse Cour, by the side of the Place Latry.</p>

<p>Many voices cried out “The King! the King!”</p>

<p>One voice alone replied, “If it is the King you want,
you will have him dead!”</p>

<p>Recognizing Drouet’s voice, and thinking perhaps he
might want me, I crept to his side.</p>

<p>At the moment that I opened a passage to him they were
parleying; but M. Drouet and his friends parleyed with
muskets in their hands, and the officers of hussars with
their sabres on their wrists.</p>

<p>Between the two officers of hussars I recognised M. de
Malmy on horseback, and covered with dust, like them.</p>

<p>It appeared as if he had guided them.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXVI">CHAPTER XXVI.<br>
<span class="fs70">WHAT HAPPENED AT PARIS BEFORE THE DEPARTURE.</span></h2>


<p>My story would be incomplete did I not follow the royal
family in their flight from the moment that they left the
Palace of Tuileries, till their appearance at the top of the
<span lang="fr">Rue des Réligieuses</span>; and did I not tell you through what
circumstances M. Drouet was led to make his appearance in
time to change the face of events, and to give that terrible
blow to the throne of the Bourbons which occasioned Louis
XVI not only the loss of his crown, but of his head.</p>

<p>I have already told you that Mirabeau, on his death-bed,
asserted that the King’s only hope rested in flight now that
he was deprived of his assistance.</p>

<p>From that moment, Louis XVI had but one idea—to
leave Paris—to leave France—to fly to a foreign land.</p>

<p>We have mentioned the date of April, 1791.</p>

<p>This is what happened on that date.</p>

<p>The King had wished to go to St. Cloud; that was on
the Easter Monday.</p>

<p>The King, the Queen, the bishops, the servants, filled the
carriages in which they were to make the short travel of
two leagues; but the people prevented the King from leaving
the Tuileries.</p>

<p>The King insisted; the tocsin of Saint Roch began to
sound an alarm.</p>

<p>He leaned back in his carriage; thousands of voices cried,
“No, no! He is going to fly!”</p>

<p>“I love you too well to leave you!” said the King.</p>

<p>“We, also, love you!” replied the spectators, with one
voice; “but you alone!”</p>

<p>The Queen, shut out from the love of France, wept and
stamped; but, for all that, was obliged to re-enter the
Tuileries.</p>

<p>The King was a prisoner, there was no doubt about it;
but it is permitted to a prisoner to escape.</p>

<p>From this moment the King prepared for flight.</p>

<p>Two other parties were as desirous as the King that he
should leave France.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146"></a>[146]</span></p>

<p>The one, the Royalist party, because the King, once free,
would be able to re-enter France with a foreign army; the
other, the Republican party, because they could not form a
republic, without cutting his head off.</p>

<p>Therefore, one will perceive that they who arrested the
King belonged to a third party—the Constitution.</p>

<p>His decision taken, the King began to put it into execution.</p>

<p>The Queen was the mainspring of the plot; the princesses
of the house of Austria have been invariably evil genii
to the Kings of France—Marie de Medicis, Anne of Austria,
Marie Antoinette, and Marie Louise.</p>

<p>The King might have fled alone, and that was the idea
that first occurred to him; in which case he would have travelled
on horseback.</p>

<p>But, during the terrible night of the 5th of October, the
Queen became so frightened, that she made the King swear
never to leave France without her and their children.</p>

<p>It was then resolved that they should all, King, Queen,
and children, fly together.</p>

<p>That doubled, trebled, and quadrupled the difficulty, and
made escape almost an impossibility.</p>

<p>The Queen undertook the deception.</p>

<p>The Queen had more interest than the King in leaving
France. Hear you that cry of the 18th of April, 1791,
which interpreted the feelings of a nation, and which said,
“We, also, sire! We love you, <em>but you alone</em>!”</p>

<p>In January, 1791, the flight was resolved upon.</p>

<p>In February, the King wrote to M. de Bouillé:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I have overtures to make to you on the part of
M. Mirabeau. The Count de Lamark will be our intermediate.”</p>
</div>

<p>He added:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Although these people are not very estimable, still I
have paid M. Mirabeau a good sum of money. I think
that he will be useful.”</p>
</div>

<p>M. de Bouillé replied:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Cover with gold the defection of Mirabeau. He is an
accomplished scoundrel, who will repair, through cupidity,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147"></a>[147]</span>
the evil that he has worked through vengeance; but defy
Lafayette, enthusiastic, chimerical, capable, perhaps, of
being the chief of a party, but incapable of supporting a
monarchy.”</p>
</div>

<p>Remark that De Bouillé was the cousin of Lafayette.
He was not, as one can see, blinded by the relationship.</p>

<p>About the end of April, the King wrote again to
M. de Bouillé.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I go out almost incessantly in my carriage with all my
family—a carriage made expressly to hold all.”</p>
</div>

<p>M. de Bouillé replied:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“In the place of that berlin expressly made, and which
will naturally draw attention, it will be more prudent for
your Majesty to use two English coaches.”</p>
</div>

<p>The coaches mentioned were the post-chaises in common
use at that period.</p>

<p>The counsel was good, but the Queen combated the idea.
She did not wish to be separated from the King, and did
not wish the children to be separated from herself.</p>

<p>M. de Bouillé continued:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Have with you in your perilous journey a man with the
head of a Solon, and the arm of a Hercules—one who can
plan and execute. I can point such a man out to you. He
is the Marquis d’Agout, Major of the French Guards.”</p>
</div>

<p>The King adopted this counsel. We will see, later on,
how it was that M. d’Agout did not arrive at Varennes.</p>

<p>The King, in a third letter, asked M. de Bouillé to establish
relays from Châlons to Montmedy, his intention being
to avoid Rheims, where he had been consecrated, and might
be recognized, and pass through Varennes.</p>

<p>M. de Bouillé replied, that in passing through Rheims,
the carriage blinds could be drawn down; but that he was
sorry that the King persisted in using that noticeable berlin;
that at two points on the road to Varennes there were no
post-horses, so it would be necessary to send some; and,
lastly, that as there were no soldiers on that route, it would
be necessary to order up some detachments, which might
excite suspicion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148"></a>[148]</span></p>

<p>The King persisted in going the Varennes route.</p>

<p>He sent a million in assignats to M. de Bouillé, to defray
whatever expenses there might be with regard to troops,
&amp;c., &amp;c., and asked him to send an experienced officer to reconnoitre
the road to Varennes.</p>

<p>M. de Bouillé could not but obey so positive a command.</p>

<p>He sent, on the 10th of June, M. Goguelot to reconnoitre—a
mission fitted only for a courageous and intelligent officer.</p>

<p>M. Goguelot was both.</p>

<p>On the appointed day the detachment set out.</p>

<p>One might have seen a train of artillery of six pieces
setting out for Montmedy, the Royal Germans taking the
Stenay route, a squadron of hussars going towards Dun, and
another towards Varennes; and at the same time, fifty detached
men under the command of M. de Choiseul, pushed
on for Pont-de-Somme-Vesles, where the King would meet
them as first post.</p>

<p>Afterwards, at St. Menehould, he would have found a detachment
of dragoons, under the command of M. Dandouins.</p>

<p>At Clermont he would have found another detachment,
under the command of M. de Damas.</p>

<p>He would have found the relays and a detachment of
hussars, under the command of MM. Bouillé, <i lang="fr">fils</i>, and De
Raigecourt, at Varennes, and at Stenay he would have
found M. Stenay in person.</p>

<p>All being arranged, the King wrote to De Bouillé, fixing
the day for the 19th of the June following.</p>

<span class="fs70">HOW THEY SET OUT.</span></h2>


<p>This was the third or fourth time that the date of departure
had been altered.</p>

<p>They had determined to depart on the 11th, but having
refused to take Madame de Rochereul, <i lang="fr">femme-de-chambre</i>
to the Dauphin, and mistress of M. de Gouvion, aide-de-camp<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149"></a>[149]</span>
to Lafayette, and who was now on duty till the 12th,
they thought that it was imprudent to depart on that day.</p>

<p>On the 13th of June, the Austrians began to advance on
the French frontier, and to occupy posts two leagues from
Montmedy.</p>

<p>The departure was postponed until the 15th following.</p>

<p>On the evening of the 15th, the King set out with the
royal family, in a plain carriage, the berlin awaiting them
at Bondy.</p>

<p>If the King did not arrive at Bondy at two o’clock, it
was arranged that it should be taken for granted that he
had been stopped at the Tuileries or at the barrier.</p>

<p>In that case, it was arranged that the person in charge
of the berlin should set out alone, and not stop till he
arrived at Pont-de-Somme-Vesles; and when there, that
he should inform M. de Choiseul that the project had
failed.</p>

<p>M. de Choiseul would then tell M. Dandouins, M. de
Damas, M. de Bouillé, and each would provide for their
own safety.</p>

<p>M. de Bouillé received these new instructions, and arranged
accordingly.</p>

<p>M. de Choiseul set out at the same time for Paris.</p>

<p>At Paris, M. de Choiseul awaited the orders of the King,
and started twelve hours in advance.</p>

<p>The men and horses belonging to M. de Choiseul would
stay at Varennes from the 18th.</p>

<p>On the 19th, fresh and renovated, they would pass
through Varennes, and put up at a farm, half-way between
Varennes and Neuvilly. One must call to mind that there
was no post at Varennes.</p>

<p>On the arrival of the King, they would take the place of
the post-horses from Clermont, and conduct the royal family
to Dun.</p>

<p>On his return, M. de Choiseul, who, as we said, preceded
the King by twelve hours, would take command of the forty
hussars at Pont-de-Somme-Vesles. At Pont-de-Somme-Vesles
he would await the King, and would escort him to
St. Menehould. At St. Menehould the hussars would give
place to the dragoons, and be left to block the road.</p>

<p>After the King, no one would be allowed to pass.</p>

<p>After twenty-four hours the road would be left clear,
for by that time the King would be beyond the frontier.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150"></a>[150]</span></p>

<p>M. de Choiseul had orders signed by the King, authorizing
him to demand the needful number of men. Six
hundred louis d’or were distributed by him to the soldiers.</p>

<p>On the 14th of June, M. de Bouillé, who was in Hungary,
received a letter from the King.</p>

<p>The departure is postponed for twenty-four hours.
Whence came this new delay?</p>

<p>We will tell you: the reason was a serious one.</p>

<p>The King did not receive his quarterly income until the
20th; and being economical, he did not wish to lose it.</p>

<p>This reason, good as it was, made M. de Bouillé despair.</p>

<p>In fact it made it necessary to give fresh orders all along
the line. Instead of two days, the relays would have to
wait three; the same with the troops.</p>

<p>On the 20th of June, M. de Bouillé advanced to Stenay,
where he found the Royal Germans.</p>

<p>We have already seen that, on the same day, the hussars
arrived at St. Menehould, announcing the arrival of the
dragoons.</p>

<p>We know, through M. Drouet, what a sensation their unexpected
appearance created.</p>

<p>We have seen another hussar detachment arrive at
Varennes, causing little less sensation than their brothers-in-arms
did at St. Menehould.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Let us now turn our attention to Paris, and see what was
going on these last few days.</p>

<p>We have already said that the Queen managed the diplomacy.
She diplomatised wonderfully.</p>

<p>Firstly, she had used the white horses which drew the
funeral car of M. Voltaire.</p>

<p>Secondly, on the 19th, she took a stroll with the Dauphin
on the outer boulevards.</p>

<p>Thirdly, on the 20th, she said to M. Montmorin, Minister
of Foreign Affairs, “Have you seen Madame Elizabeth?
She causes me pain. I wished her to accompany me in the
procession of the Fête Dieu, and she refuses me.”</p>

<p>On the same day, meeting a commander of the National
Guard, “Well, monsieur,” said she, laughing, “do they
still speak of the flight of the King from Paris?”</p>

<p>“No, Madame,” replied the commander; “they are too
well convinced of the King’s love for the Constitution and
for his people.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151"></a>[151]</span></p>

<p>“They are right,” replied the Queen.</p>

<p>On the 17th, M. Moustier, <span lang="fr">ex-garde du corps</span>, had been
accosted by an unknown whilst he was walking in the
Tuileries.</p>

<p>The unknown had invited him to follow him in the name
of the King.</p>

<p>M. Moustier had obeyed. Ten minutes afterwards he
was in the presence of the King.</p>

<p>Louis XVI saluted him by name.</p>

<p>The <span lang="fr">garde du corps</span>, astonished, bowed.</p>

<p>“I know you, monsieur,” said the King, “and feel assured
that I can count upon you; that is why I am now
addressing you.”</p>

<p>“Whatever your wishes may be, I hope I shall prove
myself worthy of your confidence, sire.”</p>

<p>“Think you that I can count equally well on your two
friends, De Valory and De Malden?”</p>

<p>“I am assured of it, sire.”</p>

<p>“Well, tell them to have made vests of chamois leather,
trousers of hide, jack-boots, and velvet caps.”</p>

<p>The choice of chamois leather was most imprudent, as it
was the color of the Prince de Condé, when he emigrated.</p>

<p>M. de Moustier was then asked to walk every evening
on the Pont Royal. There, a confidential servant, who
knew him by sight, would bring him the last orders of the
King.</p>

<p>On the evening of the 19th, M. Moustier received the
following order:—</p>

<p>“M. de Moustier and his companions are desired to be in
the court of the Château to-morrow, at nine o’clock in the
evening; they will then learn what is required of them.”</p>

<p>Now, about the passport. We know that the Queen
travelled under the name of the Baroness de Korff. The
two children were the Dauphin and Madame Royal; the
intendant was the King; and the two <i lang="fr">femmes-de-chambre</i>
Mesdames de Neuville and Brunier.</p>

<p>That did not comprise, it is true, Madame Elizabeth, or
M. d’Agout, whom M. de Bouillé had recommended the
King to take with him, but they were obliged to trust
something to chance.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 20th, M. Moustier presented his
two companions to the King.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152"></a>[152]</span></p>

<p>M. Malden was to take the name of Jean, M. de Moustier
the name of Melchior, and M. Valory the name of
François. As for M. de Choiseul, he awaited the orders of
the King at his house, Rue d’Artois, on the 20th. Up to
three o’clock, he had heard nothing, and he ought to start
twelve hours in advance of the King. He began to
despair, when a servant entered to say that a messenger
had arrived from the Queen.</p>

<p>He ordered the messenger to be shown up.</p>

<p>The fellow entered. He had a great hat thrust over his
eyes, and was wrapped in an immense cloak.</p>

<p>It was the Queen’s hair-dresser, the famous Léonard, who
has left his memoirs to posterity. He was a personage of
the utmost importance.</p>

<p>“What, Léonard! It was not you whom I expected;
but, since you are come, make yourself at home.”</p>

<p>“It is not my fault if I have kept you waiting, M. le
Comte; but it is but ten minutes since I left the Queen to
come here.”</p>

<p>“And she has told you nothing, given you no message?”
cried the Count, astonished.</p>

<p>“She told me to take all her diamonds, and bring you
this letter.”</p>

<p>“Well, well—give it me!”</p>

<p>M. de Choiseul read the letter.</p>

<p>It was long, and full of instructions. It announced
that they would leave punctually to the moment.</p>

<p>As to the Comte de Choiseul, it commanded him to set
out that instant, begging him to take Léonard with him,
who, continued Marie Antoinette, had orders to obey him as
he would herself.</p>

<p>M. de Choiseul read aloud that recommendation to Léonard,
who made a lowly obeisance.</p>

<p>He then burnt the letter.</p>

<p>At this moment one of the Comte’s servant entered.</p>

<p>“The carriage awaits M. le Comte,” said he.</p>

<p>“Come, my dear Léonard—come!” said the young gentleman.</p>

<p>“Why should I come?” cried the stupefied hair-dresser.</p>

<p>“Why should you? Are you not to obey me as you
would the Queen? Come! I command you!”</p>

<p>“But her Majesty’s diamonds?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153"></a>[153]</span></p>

<p>“You will bring them with you.”</p>

<p>“Where?”</p>

<p>“Where we are going.”</p>

<p>“But where are we going?”</p>

<p>“A few leagues from here, where we have to fulfil a most
particular and important mission.”</p>

<p>“Impossible, M. le Comte!” cried Léonard, drawing himself
back with affright.</p>

<p>“Léonard, you forget that her Majesty said that you were
to obey me as you would herself.”</p>

<p>He then assisted the despairing hair-dresser to mount into
the cabriolet, and lashed the horse into full speed in the direction
of the Petite Vilette.</p>

<p>At the same hour that M. de Choiseul passed the barrier
the three guards were admitted to the presence of the King,
and then shut up in an ante-chamber.</p>

<p>At ten o’clock M. de Lafayette was announced.</p>

<p>He was attended by MM. de Gouvion and De Romeuf,
his aides-de-camp.</p>

<p>Madame de Rochereul, his mistress, had told him that
the flight was arranged for the same night.</p>

<p>The Queen and Madame Elizabeth had gone in the evening,
without an escort, to promenade in the <span lang="fr">Bois de Boulogne</span>.</p>

<p>M. de Lafayette, with the exquisite politeness which was
one of his characteristics, asked the Queen if she had enjoyed
her stroll; and added, “Your Majesty was wrong to
stay out so late.”</p>

<p>“Why so, sir?” asked the Queen.</p>

<p>“Because the evening fog might do you an injury.”</p>

<p>“What! a fog in the middle of June?” said she. “In
truth, unless I manufactured one on purpose to hide our
flight, which people talk so much about, I do not know
where I should find one.”</p>

<p>“The fact is, madame,” replied the General, “people
not only talk about your flight, but I have received information
that it will take place this evening.”</p>

<p>“Ah!” said the Queen; “I engage that it is
M. de Gouvion who has given you that good news.”</p>

<p>“Why I, madame?” said the young officer, blushing.</p>

<p>“I do not know,” replied the Queen, “except that, perhaps,
you hear a great deal more than is true at the château.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154"></a>[154]</span>
Wait! Here is M. Romeuf, who hears no news; I
am sure he will contradict the rumor.”</p>

<p>“There is no great credit in doing that, madame,” said
the young man, “when the King has given his word to
the Assembly not to leave Paris.”</p>

<p>At ten o clock, General Lafayette and his aides-de-camp
retired.</p>

<p>When they were gone, the Queen and Madame Elizabeth
summoned their domestics to perform the necessary offices
of their toilettes, and at eleven, as was their custom, they
retired for the night.</p>

<p>The doors shut, each commenced to dress.</p>

<p>The Queen and Madame Elizabeth assisted each other.
They had some plain dresses, and hats, with hoods, to hide
the face.</p>

<p>They had scarcely finished their disguise, when the King
entered, in his costume of intendant.</p>

<p>For the last eight days, the King’s valet, Hue, had been
in the habit of going out in the costume the King now
wore, and by the same door the King intended to depart
from. This was done in order to accustom the sentinel to
a man dressed in gray.</p>

<p>On arriving, he released the three guards from their
hiding-place.</p>

<p>Madame Royale was ready, but the Dauphin was not.
He had been awakened from his first sleep; and so, for the
sake of disguise, it had been arranged to dress him like a
girl. He made all sorts of objections to the humiliating
costume.</p>

<p>He asked, “If he were intended to act in a comedy?”
They replied “Yes.” And as he liked comedies, he allowed
them to finish his toilette.</p>

<p>The <span lang="fr">gardes du corps</span> received their last instructions.</p>

<p>They were to travel as far as Bondy on M. de Fersen’s
horses; after that they were to take post.</p>

<p>They had calculated that, if they went at a moderate rate,
they would be at Châlons in twelve or fourteen hours.
They approached the door, and listened. All was silent.</p>

<p>Let us see with what difficulties they encompassed themselves.</p>

<p>Firstly, against M. de Bouillé’s advice, who proposed two
English diligences, the Queen had had made two enormous
berlins, in which she might put her trunks, boxes and bags.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155"></a>[155]</span></p>

<p>Then, in place of having a courier in simple livery, there
were three <span lang="fr">gardes du corps</span>, in the livery of the Prince de
Condé.</p>

<p>Then, in place of choosing three men who knew the
route, they chose three who had never travelled that way
before.</p>

<p>Then, in place of hiding the King, who was supposed to
be Madame de Korff’s steward, in the other carriage, he
was placed face to face and knee to knee, with his pretended
mistress, in the principal conveyance.</p>

<p>Then, in place of having the carriages drawn by two, or
even four, horses, they must needs have six, not remembering
that the King alone is allowed to have that number.</p>

<p>Then, in place of arming the <span lang="fr">gardes du corps</span> to the
teeth, they give them small hunting-knives for use, and
locked up the pistols and other implements of warfare in
the trunk, covered with red, bordered with gold, the same
as the King used at Cherbourg.</p>

<p>Then, in place of taking M. d’Agout, that resolute man
who knew the route, and whom M. de Bouillé had recommended,
they take Madame Tourzel, the children’s governess,
who claimed the place by etiquette that D’Agout
would have won by devotion.</p>

<p>Taking all in all, every precaution was taken.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXVIII">CHAPTER XXVIII.<br>
<span class="fs70">THE ROAD.</span></h2>


<p>In a moment, the clock struck eleven.</p>

<p>Every stroke penetrated the hearts of the fugitives, and
caused them to tremble.</p>

<p>They went out, one by one. But how were they able to
make a passage to the court, you will ask? This is how it
was.</p>

<p>Madame de Rochereul, whose duties had finished on the
12th, occupied a little chamber which opened into another,
which had not been used for six months.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156"></a>[156]</span></p>

<p>The empty apartment was M. Villequier’s, first gentleman
of the bed-chamber. It was empty because M. Villequier
had emigrated.</p>

<p>That apartment, situate on the ground floor, had a door
opening into the <span lang="fr">Cour des Princes</span>.</p>

<p>On one side, the chamber of Madame de Rochereul
opened both into one belonging to M. Villequier and Madame
Royale.</p>

<p>On the 11th, the moment that Madame Rochereul quitted
the château, the King and Queen visited her apartment.</p>

<p>Under the pretext of enlarging Madame Royale’s suite
of rooms, the Queen kept these apartments, and said that
the <i lang="fr">femme-de-chambre</i> of the Dauphin could share those
of Madame de Chinnai, maid of honor.</p>

<p>When in the apartment of M. Villequier, the King
demanded the key of M. Renard, inspector of buildings.
It was sent to him on the 13th of June.</p>

<p>Numerous as were the sentinels, they had neglected to
place one at the door of that chamber, which had been
unoccupied for the space of three months. At eleven
o’clock in the evening, the services in the château being
finished, the sentinels were accustomed to witness the
departure of a great number of people at one time.</p>

<p>So that once in the apartment of M. Villequier, and as
the clock struck eleven, they had every chance of escaping
unobserved.</p>

<p>It was M. de Fersen’s business to smuggle the royal
family out of Paris, unobserved.</p>

<p>He was waiting with a fiacre, disguised as a coachman,
at the <span lang="fr">Wicket de l’Echelle</span>; thence he was to take the
fugitives to the barrier at Clichy, where the berlin was in
waiting, under the charge of an Englishman, Mr. Crawford.</p>

<p>The three <span lang="fr">gardes du corps</span> were to follow, in another
fiacre.</p>

<p>The two <i lang="fr">femmes-de-chambre</i>, Madame Brunier and Madame
de Neuville, went on foot to the Pont Royal, where
they found a two-horsed carriage stationed, in which they
started for Claye, where they were to await the Queen.</p>

<p>Madame Elizabeth stepped out first, with Madame Royale;
then came Madame de Tourzel, and the Dauphin,
accompanied by one of the <span lang="fr">gardes du corps</span>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157"></a>[157]</span></p>

<p>The two parties were separated one from the other by
about twenty paces.</p>

<p>One of the sentinels crossed the road, and on seeing the
first party, stopped them.</p>

<p>“Oh, aunt!” cried Madame Royale; “we are lost!
That man recognises us!”</p>

<p>Madame Elizabeth made no reply, but continued to
advance.</p>

<p>Madame Royale was deceived. They were not recognised—or,
if they were, it was by a friend.</p>

<p>The sentinel turned his back on them, and allowed them
to pass.</p>

<p>At the expiration of five minutes, Madame de Tourzel,
the two princesses, and the Dauphin were in the carriage,
which was awaiting them at the corner of the Rue de
l’Echelle.</p>

<p>M. de Fersen was so well disguised, that the princesses
did not recognize him. It was he who knew them. He
leapt from his box, opened the door, and assisted them in.</p>

<p>At the moment that M. de Fersen shut the door, an
empty fiacre passed by. Seeing a brother cabman stopping,
he stopped likewise, and began to enter into a conversation
about the times.</p>

<p>M. de Fersen, a man of ready wit, sustained the conversation
wonderfully, and, drawing a snuff-box from his
pocket, offered his friend a pinch.</p>

<p>He plunged his fingers deep into the box, took a long and
voluptuous sniff, and drove on.</p>

<p>At this moment the King, followed by his garde du
corps, came out in his turn, his hands in his pockets, and
swaggering like a well-to-do tradesman.</p>

<p>He was followed by the second garde.</p>

<p>During his passage, one of the buckles of his shoes
slipped off. The King did not care to stop for such a
trifling matter as that, but the garde who came after him
picked it up.</p>

<p>M. de Fersen got in front of the King.</p>

<p>“And the Queen, sire?” asked he.</p>

<p>“The Queen follows us,” replied the King.</p>

<p>He then got into the carriage in his turn.</p>

<p>They awaited the Queen.</p>

<p>Half an hour passed, and she did not arrive.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158"></a>[158]</span></p>

<p>What detained her?</p>

<p>The Queen was lost. She maintained that the Wicket
de l’Echelle was to the right. The third garde, not knowing
Paris well, yielded to the Queen’s certainty, though he fancied
that it was to the left.</p>

<p>They therefore left by the wicket at the water’s side; got
confused on the quays; crossed the bridge; walked down
the <span lang="fr">Rue du Bac</span>, where the Queen was forced to acknowledge
her error, as they had completely lost their way.</p>

<p>The garde was compelled to inquire the way to the
<span lang="fr">Wicket de l’Echelle</span>. They had to cross the Place de
Carrousel a second time. Under the arch, they found
themselves face to face with some lacqueys, carrying
torches, and escorting a carriage which was approaching at
a trot. The Queen had just time to turn her face to the
wall, in order to avoid being recognised.</p>

<p>She had recognised Lafayette.</p>

<p>The garde came to the front, in order to the more effectually
screen her.</p>

<p>But she struck the wheels of the carriage with the little
cane that ladies carried at that period, saying, “Go to,
gaoler!—I am out of thy power.”</p>

<p>This is but a tradition; the garde says, on the contrary,
that the Queen was so frightened, that she dropped his arm
and fled, but that he ran after her, took her by the hand,
and drew her back.</p>

<p>They crossed the Carrousel at full speed, passed the
<span lang="fr">Wicket de l’Echelle</span>, and at last saw the carriage which
was awaiting them.</p>

<p>M. de Fersen assisted the Queen into the vehicle, and she
sank into her seat by the side of the King, trembling with
fear.</p>

<p>M. de Fersen had stopped a voiture, for the accommodation
of the three <span lang="fr">gardes du corps</span>.</p>

<p>They jumped into it, telling the driver to follow the
other vehicle.</p>

<p>M. de Fersen, who knew not Paris much better than the
<span lang="fr">garde du corps</span>, who had followed the Queen, fearing to get
lost in the streets, went to Faubourg St. Honoré, along the
length of the Tuileries.</p>

<p>Thence, he soon found his way to the barrière of Clichy.</p>

<p>A few paces before the house of Mr. Crawford, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159"></a>[159]</span>
<span lang="fr">gardes du corps</span> got down, paid and dismissed their vehicle, and
took their places behind the other.</p>

<p>The travelling berlin was ready when they arrived.</p>

<p>The change was effected.</p>

<p>M. de Fersen overturned his carriage in a ditch, then
mounted on the box of the berlin. One of his men
mounted a horse, and conducted them to Daumont.</p>

<p>They took at least an hour to arrive at Bondy.</p>

<p>All progressed capitally.</p>

<p>At Bondy, they found the two <i lang="fr">femmes-de-chambre</i>, who
were to have awaited them at Claye.</p>

<p>It appeared that they came in a cabriolet, expecting to
find at Bondy a post-chaise; but there were none, so they
had struck a bargain with the postmaster for a cabriolet,
the price of which was a thousand francs.</p>

<p>The driver of the other cabriolet was brushing down his
horse previously to returning to Paris.</p>

<p>At this place, M. de Fersen was to leave their Majesties.</p>

<p>He kissed the King’s hand, in order that he might be
able to kiss the Queen’s.</p>

<p>M. de Fersen would rejoin them in Austria.</p>

<p>He returned to Paris, to acquaint himself with what was
going on; he would then start for Brussels.</p>

<p>Man proposes, God disposes.</p>

<p>The Queen, two years later, was executed in the Place de
la Revolution; and M. de Person perished at Stockholm,
where he was slain in a riot, stricken to death by blows
from umbrellas, administered by drunken women.</p>

<p>But, mercifully, the future was not known to them.
They parted full of hope.</p>

<p>M. de Valory borrowed a post-horse, and galloped on in
advance, to command the relays.</p>

<p>M. de Malden and De Moustier took their seats on the
box of the berlin, which set off at the full speed of which
six vigorous horses were capable.</p>

<p>The cabriolet came on in the rear.</p>

<p>M. de Fersen followed with his eyes the carriage, rapidly
disappearing in the distance; and when it had entirely disappeared,
he got into his own carriage, and returned to
Paris.</p>

<p>He had on his costume as coachman; and much did it
astonish the driver of the cabriolet to see a coachman kissing
the hands of the King, disguised as a domestic.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_160"></a>[160]</span></p>

<p>It is true that M. de Fersen had only kissed the King’s
hands in order to be able to go through the same ceremony
with regard to the Queen.</p>

<p>That was another imprudence added to those which we
have already mentioned.</p>

<p>All went well as far as Montmirail, where the traces of
the royal carriage snapped asunder.</p>

<p>It was necessary to stop. They thus lost two hours—the
days were long; the night of the 20th of June is the shortest
in the year.</p>

<p>Then they came to a hill. The King insisted on their
walking up; thus they lost another half-hour.</p>

<p>Half-past four sounded from the cathedral as the berlin
entered Châlons, and stopped at the post-house, then situated
at the end of the Rue St. Jacques.</p>

<p>M. de Valory approached the carriage.</p>

<p>“All goes well, Francis,” said the Queen to him. “It
seems to me that, if there had been an intention of stopping
us, it would have been put into execution before now.”</p>

<p>In speaking to M. de Valory, the Queen disclosed her
countenance.</p>

<p>The King likewise imprudently showed himself.</p>

<p>The postmaster, Oudes, recognized him; one of the spectators,
whom curiosity had drawn to the spot, at once knew
that it was the King.</p>

<p>The postmaster saw the above-mentioned spectator disappear,
and consequently feared some evil to the King.</p>

<p>“Sire,” said he, in a whisper, “for heaven’s sake do not
expose yourself, or you are lost!” Then, speaking to the
postilions, “How now, idlers!” cried he. “Is this the
way that you treat well-to-do travellers who pay thirty
sous?”</p>

<p>And he himself, to set an example to the postilions, put
his shoulder to the work.</p>

<p>The horses were put to, and the carriage was in readiness
speedily.</p>

<p>“Off you go!” cried the postmaster.</p>

<p>The first postilion wished to raise his horses into a gallop.
They both fell, but gained their feet again on the application
of the whip. They wished to upset the carriage.
The two horses under the guidance of the second postilion
fell in their turn.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161"></a>[161]</span></p>

<p>They drew the postilion from under the horse he had
been riding, with the loss of one of his boots.</p>

<p>The horses picked themselves up, the postilion regained
his boot, and, putting it on, he remounted his saddle.</p>

<p>Off goes the carriage.</p>

<p>The travelers breathe again.</p>

<p>But as the postmaster had warned them of danger, in
place of riding in front, M. de Valory took up his position
by the side of the carriage.</p>

<p>The fact of the horses having fallen one after the other,
without any apparent reason, seemed to the Queen a presage
of evil to come.</p>

<p>As yet, however, they had escaped the consequences of
recognition.</p>

<p>The man who witnessed the arrival of the berlin had ran
to the Mayor’s house; but that official was a Royalist.
However, the witness swore that he recognised the King
and the other members of the royal family; so the Mayor,
driven into his last entrenchment, was forced to proceed
forthwith to the Rue St. Jacques; but, happily, when he
arrived there, he found that the carriage had started some
five minutes before.</p>

<p>Passing through the gates of the city, and noticing the
ardor with which the postilion urged on their steeds, the
Queen, and Madame Elizabeth gave vent each to the same
cry:—“We are saved!”</p>

<p>But at that very moment a man, arisen, as it were, suddenly
from the very bosom of the earth, passed on horseback
to the door of the carriage, and said, “Your measures
are badly taken! You will be stopped!”</p>

<p>It was never known who this man was.</p>

<p>By good luck, they were distant only four leagues from
Pont-de-Somme-Vesles, where M. de Choiseul was awaiting
them with his forty hussars.</p>

<p>Perhaps they should have sent M. de Valory to the rear,
in order to prevent this.</p>

<p>But the last warning had increased the Queen’s terrors,
and she would not part with one of her defenders.</p>

<p>They incited the postilions to greater speed.</p>

<p>The four leagues were accomplished in an hour.</p>

<p>They arrived at Pont-de-Somme-Vesles, a little hamlet,
consisting of two or three houses. They pierced with their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162"></a>[162]</span>
eyes the wood which overshadowed the farm to the left; and
the trees which indicated the windings of the river on the
right, formed, as it were, a curtain of green to hide the
modest streamlet from the curious eye, but still no De
Choiseul, no De Goguelot, no forty hussars were to be seen.</p>

<p>On seeing that the place was desolate, the Queen uttered
the words “We are lost!”</p>

<p>In the meantime, let us explain why the hussars were not
at their post.</p>

<p>At eleven o’clock M. de Choiseul, still accompanied by
Léonard, in tears, who knew not where they were taking
him, and who believed himself to be the victim of some unjustifiable
violence, arrived at Pont-de-Somme-Vesles.</p>

<p>The hussars, as yet, were not at their posts; all around
was tranquil.</p>

<p>He alighted at the post-house, his example being followed
by Léonard, who had the diamonds still concealed in his
bosom, and asked for a private chamber in which to don his
uniform.</p>

<p>Léonard watched him; his cup of misery was filled to the
brim.</p>

<p>Now that M. de Choiseul had, as he believed, nothing to
fear, he found time to pity him.</p>

<p>“My dear Léonard!” said he, “it is time that you knew
the whole truth.”</p>

<p>“How the truth? Do I not, then, already know the
truth?”</p>

<p>“You know a portion. It is now my duty to tell you the
rest. You are devoted to your customers, are you not, my
dear Léonard?”</p>

<p>“In life and death, M. le Comte.”</p>

<p>“Well, in two hours they will be here—in two hours they
will be saved.”</p>

<p>The hot tears coursed down poor Léonard’s cheeks, but
this time they were tears of joy.</p>

<p>“In two hours?” cried he, at last. “Are you sure of
it?”</p>

<p>“Yes; they were to have left the Tuileries at eleven or
half-past, in the evening; they were to arrive at Châlons at
mid-day; and an hour, or, at most, an hour and a half, is
sufficient to cover the four leagues from Châlons to this
place. They will be here in an hour at the latest. I am<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163"></a>[163]</span>
awaiting a detachment of hussars, which should arrive here
under the command of M. Goguelot.”</p>

<p>Hearing a rumbling sound, M. de Choiseul put his head
out of the window.</p>

<p>“Ah, there they are, coming from the direction of Cilloy!”</p>

<p>And, in fact, the hussars were, at the moment, on the
point of entering the village.</p>

<p>“Come on!—all is well!” said M. de Choiseul.</p>

<p>And he waved his hat, making signs out of the window.</p>

<p>A horseman approached at a gallop.</p>

<p>M. de Choiseul went down stairs to meet him.</p>

<p>The two gentlemen met in the high road.</p>

<p>The horseman, who was M. Goguelot, gave M. de Choiseul
a packet from M. de Bouillé. This packet contained six
blank signatures, and a copy of the order which had been
given by the King to every officer of the army whatsoever
his grade, commanding them in all things to obey M. de
Choiseul.</p>

<p>The hussars rode up. M. de Choiseul ordered them to
picket their horses, and caused rations of bread and wine to
be served out to them.</p>

<p>The news which M. Goguelot brought was bad. All
along his route, everybody had been in a state of expectation.
The reports of the King’s flight, which had been disseminated
about for more than a year, had spread from Paris
to the provinces; and the sight of the different bodies of
men arriving at Dun, Varennes, Clermont, and St. Menehould,
had awakened suspicion. The tocsin had been sounded
in a village by the side of the road.</p>

<p>M. de Choiseul had ordered dinner for M. de Goguelot
and himself.</p>

<p>The two young men drew up to the table, leaving the detachment
under the command of M. de Boudet.</p>

<p>At the expiration of half an hour, M. de Choiseul fancied
that he heard a noise outside the door.</p>

<p>He went out.</p>

<p>The peasants from the neighboring villages had begun to
crowd round the soldiers.</p>

<p>Whence came these peasants, in a country which was almost
a desert?</p>

<p>It was surmised that some days before the inhabitants of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164"></a>[164]</span>
a tract of land, near Pont-de-Somme-Vesles, belonging to
Madame d’Elbœuf, had refused the payment of irredeemable
rights, on the strength of which they had been threatened
with military law.</p>

<p>But the federation of 1790 had made France one great
family; and the peasants of the villages had promised the
tenants of Madame d’Elbœuf to use their arms if any
soldiers showed themselves in the vicinity.</p>

<p>As we know, forty had arrived.</p>

<p>On seeing them Madame d’Elbœuf’s tenants believed
that they had come with hostile intentions against them;
so they sent messages to all the neighboring villages, imploring
them to keep their promise.</p>

<p>Those situate nearest arrived first, and that is how M. de
Choiseul, on arising from table, found a turbulent throng
of peasants surrounding the hussars.</p>

<p>He believed that curiosity alone had drawn them thither,
and, without paying any further attention to them, gained
the most elevated part of the road, which runs in a straight
line through the plain of Châlons to St. Menehould.</p>

<p>A little further on than could be seen with the naked eye
was the village itself.</p>

<p>An hour slipped away.</p>

<p>Two hours, three hours, four hours, followed in the track
of the first.</p>

<p>The fugitives ought to have arrived in one hour at
Pont-de-Somme-Vesles; and the time they had lost on the
road made it half-past four, as we have said, before they
arrived at Châlons.</p>

<p>M. de Choiseul was anxious.</p>

<p>Léonard was in despair.</p>

<p>About three o’clock, the numbers of peasants increased;
their intentions became more hostile, and the tocsin began
to sound.</p>

<p>The hussars were, perhaps, more unpopular than any
other corps in the army, on account of their supposed plundering
propensities. The peasants provoked them by all
sorts of insults and menaces, and sang under their very
noses—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indentq">“The hussars are forlorn,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And we laugh them to scorn.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165"></a>[165]</span></p>

<p>Presently better informed people came up, and spread a
report that the hussars had come, not to injure Madame
d’Elbœuf’s tenants, but to escort the King and Queen.</p>

<p>This was also a very serious matter.</p>

<p>At about half-past four, M. de Choiseul and his hussars
were so completely hemmed in, that the three officers counselled
together as to what was best to be done.</p>

<p>They agreed unanimously that it was impossible that
they could hold out much longer.</p>

<p>The number of peasants was augmented to about three
hundred, many of whom were armed.</p>

<p>If, by ill luck, the King and Queen arrived at this critical
juncture, forty men, supposing that each killed his
adversary, would be insufficient to protect them.</p>

<p>M. de Choiseul re-read his orders:—</p>

<p>“Manage in such a manner that the King’s carriage shall
continue its progress without interruption.”</p>

<p>But his presence and that of the forty men became an
obstacle instead of a support.</p>

<p>There was no doubt about it. Their best plan was to
depart.</p>

<p>But a pretext must be found.</p>

<p>M. de Choiseul, in the midst of some five or six hundred
gaping peasants who surrounded him, summoned the postmaster.</p>

<p>“Monsieur,” said he, “we are here for the purpose of
escorting a treasure, but this treasure does not arrive. Do
you know if any gold has been this last day or so to
Metz?”</p>

<p>“This morning,” replied the postmaster, “the diligence
brought a hundred thousand crowns, and was escorted by
two gendarmes.”</p>

<p>If the postmaster had been prompted, he could not have
spoken better.</p>

<p>“It was Robin and me who escorted it,” cried a gendarme,
hidden among the crowd.</p>

<p>Then M. de Choiseul, turning to M. Goguelot, said,
“Monsieur, the Ministry have preferred the ordinary mode
of carriage. As a hundred thousand crowns have passed
through here this morning, our further presence here is unnecessary.
Trumpeter, sound boot and saddle, and we will
be off.”</p>

<p>The trumpeter obeyed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166"></a>[166]</span></p>

<p>In a second, the hussars, who wished nothing better than
to be off, were mounted.</p>

<p>“Gentlemen of the hussars, march. Form by fours, and
proceed at a foot pace.”</p>

<p>And he and his forty men left Pont-de-Somme-Vesles at
five punctually by his watch.</p>

<p>The detachment was to have fallen upon Varennes. He
took the by-road in order to avoid St. Menehould, but lost
his way above Mofficourt.</p>

<p>The little troop hesitated for a moment, when a horseman
coming from Neuville saw the perplexity of M. de
Choiseul, and finding that he was a Royalist and a gentleman,
asked if he could be of any assistance to him.</p>

<p>“Indeed you can,” replied M. de Choiseul. “You can
conduct us to Varennes by the Chalade.”</p>

<p>“Follow me, then,” cried the gentleman.</p>

<p>And he placed himself at the head of the hussars.</p>

<p>This gentleman was no other than M. de Malmy, and
that is how it was that I met him on the Place Latry,
between two officers whom I knew not—namely, M. de
Choiseul and M. Goguelot.</p>

<p>There was therefore, no escort awaiting the King at
Pont-de-Somme-Vesles when he arrived there.</p>

<p>But if there was no escort, there were likewise no peasants.
The road was clear; the King therefore changed
horses without an obstacle, and started for St. Menehould.</p>

<p>At St. Menehould, M. Dandoins awaited the King’s
arrival with as much impatience as M. de Choiseul and
M. Goguelot had; and about mid-day he set out with his
lieutenant on the road to Châlons, in the hopes of seeing
some sign of his arrival.</p>

<p>This road is one long descent from St. Menehould to
Châlons. They cast their eyes for a length of two leagues
on a straight line, traced, as it were, by a pencil, between<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167"></a>[167]</span>
two rows of trees, with uncultivated green patches of
country around them.</p>

<p>Nothing was visible on the road.</p>

<p>M. Dandoins and his lieutenant returned to St. Menehould.</p>

<p>Two hours afterward they again strolled along that same
road.</p>

<p>To get to the barracks situated at the bottom of the
Faubourg Fleurion, it was necessary to pass right through
the town.</p>

<p>They returned, as on the former occasion, without having
seen anything.</p>

<p>These in-comings and out-goings excited the attention
of a population already alarmed. They perceived that the
two officers had the appearance of being restless and
uneasy.</p>

<p>To the queries put them on the subject, they replied that
they were awaiting a treasure which apparently was delayed,
and that this delay gave rise to uneasiness.</p>

<p>About seven o’clock in the evening, a courier, dressed in
a chamois leather vest, arrived, drew up at the post-house,
and commanded horses for two carriages.</p>

<p>The postmaster was Jean Baptiste Drouet.</p>

<p>M. de Dandoins approached M. de Valory.</p>

<p>“Monsieur,” said he, in a whisper, “you are preceding
the King’s carriage, are you not?”</p>

<p>“Yes, monsieur,” replied the courier; “and let me add,
that I am astonished to see you and your men in policemen’s
hats.”</p>

<p>“We did not know the exact hour of the King’s arrival.
Our presence annoys the people; demonstrations of the
most menacing character with regard to us have been made,
and they have tried to entice away my men.”</p>

<p>“Silence,” said M. de Valory; “they hear what we are
saying. Rejoin your men, sir, and try to keep them to
their duty.”</p>

<p>MM. de Valory and de Dandoins then separated.</p>

<p>At the same moment the crackings of a whip were
heard, and the two carriages crossed the <span lang="fr">Place de l’Hotel
de Ville</span>.</p>

<p>They drew up in front of the post-house.</p>

<p>One can easily recognise the house, then built about
three years, and which bears upon its face the date 1788.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168"></a>[168]</span></p>

<p>Scarcely had the carriage stopped, when crowds of people
surrounded them.</p>

<p>One of the lookers-on asked M. Malden, who was
descending from the box, “Who are the travellers who
journey in this style?”</p>

<p>“Madame the Baronne de Korff,” replied de Malden.</p>

<p>“What! another of the exiles who are sucking at the
vitals of France?” murmured the spectator, discontentedly.</p>

<p>“No; this lady is a Russian, and, consequently, a
stranger.”</p>

<p>During this, M. de Dandoins, his policeman’s hat in his
hand, approached the carriage door, before which he stood,
respectfully.</p>

<p>“Sir officer,” said the King, “how is it that I found no
one at Pont-de-Somme-Vesles?”</p>

<p>“I was asking myself, sire, how it was that you arrived
without escort.”</p>

<p>The sight of a commander of dragoons talking with the
deepest respect to a sort of <i lang="fr">valet-de-chambre</i>, seated in the
front seat of the carriage, redoubled the astonishment of
the people, and began to change that astonishment rapidly
into suspicion.</p>

<p>Still, the King took no precaution to hide himself.</p>

<p>At this moment, M. Drouet came out from the door of
his house, and seeing the man who was talking to the commander
of the dragoons, he cried, “Just heavens—the
King!”</p>

<p>He had much the same expression of face as he had at
the federation, and his general appearance was such that
he was not easily disguised.</p>

<p>A municipal officer was there; his name was Farcy.</p>

<p>Drouet touched him on the elbow.</p>

<p>“Do you recognize that man?” said he, pointing to the
King.</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied the other. “It is the King.”</p>

<p>“Call together the municipal council.”</p>

<p>Then, running to the door of the house, “Guillaume,
Guillaume!” he cried.</p>

<p>Guillaume, who was within, ran out to him. Drouet
pointed out to him the King.</p>

<p>“That is he whom we have been expecting,” said he.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169"></a>[169]</span></p>

<p>Meanwhile M. Farcy had run to the municipality, and
there made his report.</p>

<p>Drouet followed after him, and likewise entered the municipal
council chamber.</p>

<p>Scarcely had he turned the corner of the street, than
the carriages, which had been relayed in the twinkling of
an eye, started off at a sharp trot.</p>

<p>A somewhat strange event accompanied their departure.</p>

<p>Behind the carriage a sous-officer of dragoons, whom we
have seen speaking to the King, notwithstanding his
inferior rank, pushed on at a gallop, firing, as he did so, a
pistol in the air.</p>

<p>Without doubt, it was a signal; but the citizens took it
as a sign for hostilities, especially as, on hearing it, the
dragoons rushed to their horses.</p>

<p>At this pistol-shot, cries were heard. A man who was
threshing in a barn on the left-hand side of the road, a
little above the small bridge thrown over the Aisne, left
the barn, and tried to stop the sous-officer with his flail.</p>

<p>The officer drew his sabre, cut the flail in half, and
passed on.</p>

<p>During this time the municipal council had decided that
some one should run after the royal carriages, and stop
them.</p>

<p>“But who will do it?” asked the Mayor.</p>

<p>“I will,” replied M. Drouet.</p>

<p>Other young men offered to accompany him; but he had
not at the post-house more than one horse of his own, with
the exception of a little pony, which was for his friend
Guillaume, on which he could count as well as he could on
himself. Two other citizens seized horses, and determining
not to leave them, set out with them, or, at least,
behind them.</p>

<p>They started, amid shouts of encouragement from the
whole town.</p>

<p>Two hours after, the two citizens returned on their
paltry hacks. They had not been able to keep up the
pace.</p>

<p>But M. Jean Baptiste Drouet, bearer of <em>A Warrant
from the Municipality to arrest the King</em>, and Citizen
Guillaume, continued the chase.</p>

<p>I underline the warrant given by the municipality for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_170"></a>[170]</span>
the arrest of the King, because I have never seen mention
made of it by any historian, and because, having seen the
warrant in M. Drouet’s hand, I can speak positively with
regard to the existence of the paper.</p>

<p>I wish you to understand why I lay so much stress on
the fact of the existence of a warrant. It is because M.
Jean Baptiste Drouet, sent by the municipality of St.
Menehould to arrest the King and the royal family, is not
the isolated fanatic, obeying a regicidal impulse, as the
Royalist journals and histories would have it, but a citizen
of unblemished character, who fulfilled but his duty in
obeying the commands of the magistrates of his country.</p>

<p>But to return to our tale.</p>

<p>The royal carriage started, and MM. Drouet and Guillaume
in pursuit. M. Dandoins ordered his dragoons to
mount, and follow.</p>

<p>But the order was more easily given than executed.</p>

<p>The pistol-shot fired by the sous-officer had found an
echo in the hearts—or, rather, the imaginations of—of
those who heard it. The National Guard armed themselves
with their double-barrelled guns. A tumultuous and noisy
mob gathered in front of the post-house—that is to say, on
the very road that the dragoons would be obliged to follow,
in order to come up with the royal carriages.</p>

<p>M. Dandoins was about to spring into his saddle, when
the municipal council commanded him to surrender on the
spot at the <span lang="fr">Hotel de Ville</span>.</p>

<p>He did so, and was then ordered to give his name and to
show his orders.</p>

<p>“I am named Dandoins,” replied he. “I am a Chevalier
of St. Louis, a captain in the 1st Regiment of Dragoon
Guards, and there are the orders which I have received.”</p>

<p>Suiting the action to the word, he placed on the table the
following order:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“On behalf of the King, I, François Claude Amour de
Bouillé, lieutenant-general of the King’s armies, &amp;c. The
captain of the 1st Regiment of Dragoons is ordered to
march, with forty men of his regiment, on the 19th, from
Clermont to St. Menehould, where, on the 20th and 21st,
he will await a convoy of money, which will be escorted by
a detachment of the 6th Regiment of Hussars from Pont-de-Somme-Vesles,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171"></a>[171]</span>
on the Châlons road. The dragoons and
their horses will be lodged equally among the hotel keepers.
The captain will be reimbursed for all expenses incurred for
the provender for the horses, and each dragoon will receive
increased pay in place of his rations.</p>

<p class="right">
“<span class="smcap">De Bouillé</span>.<br></p>

<p>“Metz, 14th June, 1791.”</p>
</div>

<p>At this moment the cries of the people mounted to the
chamber in which the council were assembled, interrogating
M. Dandoins. These cries demanded that the dragoons
should be disarmed.</p>

<p>“You hear, captain?” said the Mayor. “It is needful,
in order to tranquillize the people, that your men lay down
their arms. Go down, and order them to do so.”</p>

<p>“I will do so, if you will give me a written authority,”
replied M. Dandoins.</p>

<p>The order was given, and at the command of
M. Dandoins the arms of the dragoons, and the accoutrements
of the horses, were carried into the <span lang="fr">Hotel de Ville</span>.</p>

<p>At the moment M. Dandoins and his lieutenant M. La
Cour, reappeared at the door of the <span lang="fr">Hotel de Ville</span> opening
on the Place, the exasperation of the multitude reached a
culminating point. Every voice cried, “He is a traitor!
He knew all! He has imposed upon the municipality!”</p>

<p>They conducted the two officers to the town prison.</p>

<p>Let us now follow the royal carriages, and, as a matter of
course, MM. Guillaume and Drouet, their pursuers.</p>

<p>They had seen them start at full gallop by the Clermont
route.</p>

<p>At eight o’clock a courier arrived from M. de Choiseul.</p>

<p>This courier was poor Léonard, with his cabriolet.</p>

<p>He came to tell M. Damas that he had left M. de
Choiseul at Pont-de-Somme-Vesles, at half-past four, and
that up to that time no courier had arrived.</p>

<p>Léonard told him also the danger that M. Gorguelot,
M. Boudet, and their forty hussars, had incurred.</p>

<p>M. Damas ran no less risk. The same excitement prevailed
everywhere. The sight of his soldiers had provoked
murmurs. The hour for retreat approached, and he knew
that it would be difficult to keep the men under arms, and
the horses saddled, during the whole night, so manifest had
the hostile demonstrations become.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172"></a>[172]</span></p>

<p>In this interval the cracking of postilions’ whips announced
from afar the arrival of the carriages.</p>

<p>M. Bouillé’s orders were to mount half an hour after the
passage of the carriages, and to fall back upon Montmedy,
in passing by Varennes.</p>

<p>M. de Damas rushed to the door, told the King what
orders he had received from de Bouillé, and asked him what
his orders were.</p>

<p>“Let the carriages pass without making any remark,”
replied the King, “and follow with your dragoons.”</p>

<p>During this time, incredible as it may appear, a discussion
arose between the person charged with the payment of
the postilion and the postmaster.</p>

<p>It is a double post from St. Menehould to Varennes.
They did not wish to pay more than single. Ten minutes
were lost in this squabble, which estranged the people, who
were helping.</p>

<p>At last, the carriages set off.</p>

<p>They could have been half a league distant when Drouet
arrived.</p>

<p>Above Islettes, he and Guillaume separated, Guillaume
took the short cut by the wood, and thus gained a league;
while Drouet followed the road, striving to arrive at
Clermont before the King or, if he could not succeed in
that, at any rate to catch him up at Varennes.</p>

<p>On the other hand, thanks to the advantage which the
short cut gave him, Guillaume was sure to arrive at
Varennes before the King.</p>

<p>If the King took the Châlons route, Drouet would arrive
at Verdun before him.</p>

<p>Drouet arrived at Châlons, not in time to arrest the
King, but in time to prevent the dragoons from following
him.</p>

<p>M. de Damas’s dragoons were on horseback. M. de
Damas ordered them to march four deep, with their swords
drawn in their hand; but they stood motionless, thrusting
their swords into their scabbards.</p>

<p>At this moment, the municipal officers appeared. They
commanded M. de Damas to order his men back to their
barracks, as the hour for retreat had passed away.</p>

<p>During this time, Drouet had changed his horse and
started off at a gallop.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173"></a>[173]</span></p>

<p>M. de Damas, who had not yet lost all hope of taking off
his men, doubted to what end M. Drouet had set off. He
called a dragoon, on whose fidelity he knew that he could
depend; ordered him to catch up Drouet; stop him from
following that road; and, if he resisted to slay him.</p>

<p>The name of the dragoon was Legache.</p>

<p>Without making any objection, with the passive obedience
of a soldier—perhaps with the warm devotion of a
Royalist,—he darted off in pursuit of Drouet.</p>

<p>Scarcely had he started, when, as you have already been
told, the council commanded M. de Damas to withdraw his
men into barracks.</p>

<p>But instead of obeying, like M. Dandoins, M. de Damas
drew his sword, struck his spurs into the belly of his horse,
dashed into the midst of the crowd, and cried, “All who
love me, follow!”</p>

<p>Three men alone replied to this appeal, and dashed after
M. Damas, at a gallop, down the hill of Clermont.</p>

<p>Drouet was three-quarters of a league in advance of them,
but he was pursued by a brave, determined, and well-mounted
man.</p>

<p>Only on leaving Clermont the road splits—one part
going to Verdun, the other to Varennes.</p>

<p>It was not probable that the King would go to Varennes,
where he had no relays; if that route had been indicated,
it was simply to throw pursuers off the scent.</p>

<p>Anyhow, Guillaume would be at Varennes; and as he
was a native of that place, he would have plenty of influence.</p>

<p>Drouet galloped, therefore, along the road to Verdun.</p>

<p>Scarcely had he gone two hundred yards, when he met a
postilion, who was leading some horses.</p>

<p>“Have you seen a large berlin and a cabriolet going
past, one with six horses and the other with three?”</p>

<p>“No, M. Drouet,” replied the postilion.</p>

<p>The King had therefore gone to Varennes.</p>

<p>Drouet got on the road to Varennes by cutting across
the country, after having leapt a ditch.</p>

<p>This error, in all probability, saved him.</p>

<p>The dragoon, Lagache—who knew that the King had
gone to Varennes, and not to Verdun, and who saw Drouet
take the road to Verdun,—did not think it worth while to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174"></a>[174]</span>
pursue him much longer; and when he saw him change
his route, it was too late—he was a good half-hour in
advance of him.</p>

<p>In the midst of all this, the King, continuing his route,
had left M. Dandoins and his dragoons behind him, at St.
Menehould, and M. de Damas and his at Clermont.</p>

<p>The one and the other ought to be pushing on behind
him; and in all probability there was nothing to fear in
the localities through which he was now travelling.</p>

<p>This reflection brought tranquillity to the travellers, who,
between Neuvilly and Varennes, find oblivion in sleep.</p>

<p>We have seen how M. Valory, not finding relays at his
post, had thought fit to await the illustrious travellers, in
order to consult with them.</p>

<p>We have seen the Queen descend from the berlin, take
the arm of M. Valory, and interrogate M. Préfontaine.</p>

<p>We have seen M. Préfontaine advance, trembling, to the
door of the King’s carriage, answer his interrogatories,
return to his house, shut his door, and afterwards open his
window.</p>

<p>We have seen M. Drouet appear like a phantom from
the midst of the shadow, forbidding the postilions to proceed,
and rushing through the <span lang="fr">Rue des Réligieuses</span> on to
the <span lang="fr">Place de Latry</span>.</p>

<p>We have seen the royal berlin stopped, and the occupants
forced to descend, and accept the hospitality of M. Sauce,
who ushered into a chamber on the first floor of his house
the King, the Queen, Madame Elizabeth, Madame de
Tourzel, Madame Royale, and the young Dauphin. The
windows of this chamber were separated from the windows
of mine by a passage, some seven or eight feet in breadth
only.</p>

<p>We have also heard the noise at the top of the Rue
Basse Cour, which was made by the arrival of the forty
hussars of M. Goguelot and M. de Choiseul, in the midst
of whom I recognised M. de Malmy, who had, without
doubt, served as their guide.</p>

<p>We can, therefore—a light being thrown on the past,—resume
the thread of our story, without fear of complication
or confusion.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXX">CHAPTER XXX.<br>
<span class="fs70">WHAT HAPPENED IN THE GROCER’S LITTLE SHOP.</span></h2>


<p>At the end of some minutes, during which they had
been parleying, M. Goguelot and M. de Choiseul contrived
to get admitted to the King.</p>

<p>M. Sauce, who, after he had conducted his guests to the
chamber in which they were confined, had descended to
get the key, remounted the stairs, followed by M. Goguelot
and M. de Choiseul.</p>

<p>On seeing M. Goguelot, the King joyously clapped his
hands, for he was the only person that he knew whom he
had as yet seen. He was, without doubt, the precursor of
assistance.</p>

<p>Behind M. Goguelot, he recognised M. de Choiseul.</p>

<p>Other footsteps were heard on the staircase—they were
those of M. de Damas.</p>

<p>The three officers, as soon as they entered, bent looks of
inquiry around them.</p>

<p>This is what they saw on entering, and what I saw from
my window.</p>

<p>A narrow room, in the midst of which was a cask, which
served as a table; on that table was placed some paper and
some glasses. In a corner stood the King and Queen; by
the window were Madame Elizabeth and Madame Royale;
in the background, the Dauphin, overcome with fatigue,
was sleeping on a bed, at the foot of which was Madame de
Tourzel; at the door were stationed the two <i lang="fr">femmes-de-chambre</i>—Madame
de Neuville and Madame de Brunier,
acting as sentinels—or, rather, two women armed with
forks.</p>

<p>The first word that the King uttered was, “Well, gentlemen,
when do we start?”</p>

<p>“When it pleases your Majesty.”</p>

<p>“Give your commands, sire,” said M. de Choiseul. “I
have with me forty hussars; but lose no time. We must
act before the citizens have an opportunity of bribing my
men.”</p>

<p>“Well, gentlemen, descend, and clear the way; but
mind, no violence.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176"></a>[176]</span></p>

<p>The young men went down.</p>

<p>The moment that M. de Goguelot had his hand on the
street door, the National Guard summoned the hussars to
dismount.</p>

<p>“Hussars,” cried M. de Goguelot, “remain in your saddles.”</p>

<p>“Wherefore?” queried the officer commanding the
National Guard.</p>

<p>“To protect the King,” replied M. de Goguelot.</p>

<p>“Good!” returned the officers; “we can take care of
him without you.”</p>

<p>A hundred voices at the same time cried, “Yes, yes,
yes! Make the hussars dismount! It is our business,
and not the business of strangers, to protect the King!
Dismount, hussars—dismount!”</p>

<p>M. de Damas slipped through the crowd, and rejoined
the three or four men who had been faithful to him.</p>

<p>M. de Goguelot exchanged signals with M. de Malmy,
and in company with M. de Choiseul again ascended to the
King’s chamber. Both addressed the Queen, as they knew
that it was her head that planned.</p>

<p>“Madame,” said M. de Goguelot, “it is no use thinking
of proceeding in the carriages; but there is a way of
safety.”</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“Will you mount a horse, and set out with the King?
He will take charge of the Dauphin. The bridge is barricaded,
but at the bottom of the Rue Jean the river is fordable.
With our forty hussars we will pass. In any case,
make a quick resolution. Our hussars are already drinking
with the people; in another quarter of an hour they will
be brothers.”</p>

<p>The Queen drew back; that iron heart failed her at that
critical moment. She again became a woman; she feared
a struggle, a skirmish—perhaps a bullet.</p>

<p>“Speak to the King, messieurs,” said she; “it is he
who should decide on this plan; it is he who should command;
it is for me but to follow.”</p>

<p>She then added, timidly, “After all, it cannot be long
before M. de Bouillé arrives.”</p>

<p>The <span lang="fr">gardes du corps</span> were there ready to attempt anything.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_177"></a>[177]</span></p>

<p>M. de Valory said, in his and the name of all his comrades,
“Her Majesty knows that she can command. We
are ready to die for her.”</p>

<p>M. de Goguelot and M. de Choiseul chimed in.</p>

<p>“M. de Damas is below,” said M. de Choiseul; “he told
us to tell your Majesty that he had but three or four dragoons,
but that he could count on their fidelity as on his
own.”</p>

<p>“Let us set out, sire—let us set out, since the Queen
places herself in your hands.”</p>

<p>If the King replied yes, there was still hope.</p>

<p>“Messieurs,” asked the King, “can you promise me that
in the struggle which must take place as a consequence of
our departure, no ball will strike the Queen, my sister, or
my children?”</p>

<p>A sigh passed the lips of the King’s defenders. They
felt him giving way in their hands.</p>

<p>“Let us reason coolly,” said the King. “The municipal
council do not refuse to let me go. The annoyance is, that
we are compelled to spend the night here; but before daybreak,
M. de Bouillé will be acquainted with the situation
in which we are. He is at Stenay. Stenay is but eight
leagues from here; two hours will take one there, and
another two suffice to bring back a message. M. de Bouillé
cannot fail to be here in the morning, then shall we depart
without danger or violence.”</p>

<p>As he uttered these words, without announcing themselves,
or asking the permission of the King to be admitted, the
municipal council entered the room.</p>

<p>The decision that they had arrived at was brief and precise.</p>

<p>The people strongly objected to the King’s continuing his
route, and had resolved to send a courier to the National
Assembly to know its sentiments.</p>

<p>In fact, a citizen of Varennes, an M. Maugin, surgeon by
profession, had started at full speed for Paris.</p>

<p>M. de Goguelot saw that there was not an instant to lose;
he dashed from the house, and found M. de Malmy at the
door.</p>

<p>“Monsieur,” he said, “you live here, therefore you
know this part of the country. A man, come what will,
must set out for Stenay to advise M. de Bouillé of the predicament<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_178"></a>[178]</span>
in which the King is placed, and return with a
sufficient force to rescue him.”</p>

<p>“I will go myself,” said M. de Malmy.</p>

<p>And sticking his spurs into his horse, he set off at a
gallop.</p>

<p>At M. Gerbaut’s door, he saw a file of National Guards,
who commanded him to stop.</p>

<p>“All very well,” replied M. de Malmy; “but I intend
to go on.”</p>

<p>“Not you, more than another!” cried an officer, seizing
his horse by the bridle.</p>

<p>“If you advance another step,” said M. Roland, the
commander of the National Guard, cocking a pistol, “I
will shoot you.”</p>

<p>M. de Malmy, without reply, spurred his horse right on
to him.</p>

<p>M. Roland fired off the pistol so close that the flame
blinded M. de Malmy’s horse, at the same time as the bullet
passed through the fleshy part of the horseman’s arm.</p>

<p>The frightened animal reared, and fell back upon his
master.</p>

<p>From the chamber where I was engaged in watching the
King, I heard the pistol-shot, the fall of the horse and
man, and the scream of a woman.</p>

<p>I recognised the voice of Mdlle. Sophie. I dashed down
stairs, and arrived in time to see her throw herself on the
breathless, and, as she thought, dead body of M. de Malmy.</p>

<p>“Réné, Réné!” she cried. “Help me—oh, help me!”</p>

<p>I rushed out of the house, took M. de Malmy in my
arms, and, at the moment when he tried to stand, I took
him into the house, and laid him on M. Gerhaut’s bed.</p>

<p>“He is dead—he is dead! They have killed him, the
wretches!” cried the unhappy and despairing girl, who was
covered with the blood which had flowed from his wound.</p>

<p>At this moment, M. de Malmy opened his eyes.</p>

<p>“He is not dead, Mdlle. Sophie,” cried I.</p>

<p>“Oh!” said she.</p>

<p>And she threw herself prostrate on the bed.</p>

<p>“Leave me—leave me!” said M. de Malmy, making an
effort to lift himself up. “I must go and seek M. de Bouillé.”</p>

<p>Pain and weakness compelled him to fall back again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179"></a>[179]</span></p>

<p>“In the name of heaven, stay there, Alphonse!” cried
Mdlle. Sophie. “Do not move, or you will uselessly throw
away your life. You owe me somewhat; grant me that
favor.”</p>

<p>“I must,” said the young man. “I think that my leg
is broken.”</p>

<p>“Réné, Réné! I pray, I implore you, my friend—my
brother—run for a surgeon!”</p>

<p>“Immediately!” said I, dashing out into the street.</p>

<p>But it was impossible to move.</p>

<p>The crowd had become something fearful.</p>

<p>“Hussars!” cried M. de Goguelot, “are you for the
King or the nation?”</p>

<p>They all replied, “For the nation!”</p>

<p>“The others?”</p>

<p>“For the King—for the King!” they cried out, in German.</p>

<p>“Do you hear them?” said M. Drouet. “They are
strangers—they are Germans—that is to say, enemies.”</p>

<p>“No, sir,” cried the officer; “it is a Frenchman, who,
in good French, says to you, ‘Make way, in the name of
the King!’”</p>

<p>“And I reply to you, in better French, if your hussars
do not lay down their arms, we will fire on them, and not
one shall leave Varennes alive. Soldiers, present arms—and,
gunners, to your pieces!”</p>

<p>Then, stepping two paces forward, he said to M. Goguelot,
“Take care, sir. I have sighted you with my gun.”</p>

<p>“<span lang="fr">Vive la nation!</span>” cried the hussars, as they saw the
musket barrels pointed at them, with the matches burning
brightly in the obscurity, and the two little pieces of cannon
placed in battery at the bottom of the Rue St. Jean.</p>

<p>At this moment, several National Guards sprang upon
M. Goguelot’s horse, snatched the rider from the saddle,
and dashed him head-foremost into the road, where he lay
for a moment or so, completely stunned.</p>

<p>They treated M. Damas and M. de Choiseul, who
appeared on the door-step at that moment, in the same
fashion.</p>

<p>In the midst of this struggle, I set out for the Place
Latry, by way of the Rue l’Horloge. When I got there, I
found that M. Maugin had started for Paris, by wish of
the municipality, at full speed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_180"></a>[180]</span></p>

<p>I ran to the house of another doctor of less skill than
M. Maugin—a M. Saulnier—and brought him to the Rue de
la Basse Cour, where the hussars were drinking and fraternizing
with the National Guard.</p>

<p>M. de Malmy was wounded in the shoulder by a ball
which had traversed the deltoid muscles. His leg was not
broken, but his knee was badly sprained.</p>

<p>Mdlle. Gerbaut, who feared that the condition of the
wounded man would not be improved by his remaining on
the ground floor in direct communication with the street,
begged us to carry M. de Malmy into a chamber where the
surgeon could pay, without inconvenience, all the cares
necessary to a man in his condition.</p>

<p>I assisted M. Saulnier—a sufficiently difficult job—to
carry a man who could use neither his left arm nor his
right leg. Afterwards, as I saw that my presence was not
welcome to Mdlle. Sophie, and as I felt no particular interest
in the wounded man, I retired, so as not to lose a single
scene of the drama which was being played out before my
eyes, and which was nothing less than a duel between a
King and a nation.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXXI">CHAPTER XXXI.<br>
<span class="fs70">THE RETURN OF ROYALTY IN ARREST.</span></h2>


<p>In the midst of the tumult which was produced by the
disarming of M. de Choiseul and M. de Damas, and the
cries of “<span lang="fr">Vive la nation!</span>” shouted out by the hussars, to
the great delight of the people, M. de Goguelot, profiting
by a moment of inattention on the part of his guards,
rushed up-stairs, and, all bleeding as he was, entered the
chamber of the King.</p>

<p>His head had been cut open by the fall, but he did not
feel the wound.</p>

<p>The appearance of the chamber had changed. It had
become a prison.</p>

<p>Marie Antoinette, who was in reality the strength and
life of the family, was overwhelmed. She had heard the
cries, the shots, and she saw M. de Goguelot return all covered
with blood.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_181"></a>[181]</span></p>

<p>The King, standing upright, prayed M. Sauce, the
grocer, to assist them; as if he had the power, even had
he wished to do so.</p>

<p>The Queen, seated on a stool between two packages of
candles, likewise implored his assistance.</p>

<p>But with brutal and petty selfishness, he replied, “I
should like to be able to serve you, certainly; but if you
think of the King, I think of M. Sauce.”</p>

<p>The Queen turned aside, shedding tears of rage.</p>

<p>She had never been so humbled before.</p>

<p>The day began to dawn.</p>

<p>The crowd filled the street, the <span lang="fr">Place de la Rue Neuve</span>,
and the <span lang="fr">Place Latry</span>.</p>

<p>All the citizens cried from their windows, “To Paris—to
Paris—to Paris with the King!”</p>

<p>Alas! to show himself—he was to appear no longer, as
on the 6th of October, on the balcony of the marble court,
but at the windows of a grocer’s house.</p>

<p>The King had fallen into a state of torpor.</p>

<p>The cries redoubled.</p>

<p>Five or six people had seen, or rather had caught a
glimpse, of the King; the others wished to inspect him
thoroughly.</p>

<p>At that period, when it took a diligence six or seven
days to go to Paris, to have seen the King was a thing to
talk about. Each one had formed an imaginary portrait
of him for him or herself.</p>

<p>Therefore the astonishment was intense when Louis the
Sixteenth showed himself with swollen eyes, and proved to
that multitude a thing which they did not before believe—namely,
that a king may be fat, pale, bloated—with dull
eyes, hanging lips, a bad peruke, and a gray suit of
clothes.</p>

<p>The crowd believed that they were being deceived, and
growled accordingly.</p>

<p>Afterwards, when they knew that it was the King, “Oh,
heavens!” said they. “Poor man!”</p>

<p>Pity having once seized them, their hearts opened, and
they began to shed tears.</p>

<p>“Long live the King!” cried the crowd.</p>

<p>If Louis XVI had profited by that moment—if he had
prayed that concourse of people to help him and his children,—perhaps<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_182"></a>[182]</span>
they would have passed him and the royal
family over the barricaded bridge, and delivered them into
the hands of the hussars.</p>

<p>He took no advantage of that pity and sorrow.</p>

<p>An example was given of the commiseration which the
royal family inspired.</p>

<p>Sauce had an aged mother—a woman of some eighty
years of age. She was born in the reign of Louis XIV,
and was a Royalist. She entered the chamber; and seeing
the King and Queen bowed down with sorrow, and the
children sleeping on the bed, which had never been destined
for such a mournful honor, she fell on her knees beside
it, repeated a prayer, and, turning towards the Queen,
“Madame,” said she, “will you allow me to kiss the hands
of the two innocents?”</p>

<p>The Queen bowed her head, in token of assent.</p>

<p>The good woman kissed their hands, and left the room,
sobbing, as if her heart would break.</p>

<p>The Queen was the only one who did not sleep.</p>

<p>The King, who had need, whatever his preoccupation of
mind might be, to eat and sleep well, having neither ate
nor slept to his satisfaction, was distracted.</p>

<p>About half-past six, M. Deslon was announced.</p>

<p>M. Deslon had arrived from Dun with about a hundred
men.</p>

<p>He had found the <span lang="fr">Rue de l’Hôpital</span> barricaded; had
held a parley; and demanding admission to the presence
of the King, was accorded permission to visit him.</p>

<p>He informed them how, at the sound of the tocsin, he
had hurried on; and that M. de Bouillé, warned by his son
and M. de Raigecourt, would, without doubt, arrive in a
short time.</p>

<p>The King, however, seemed as if he did not hear him.</p>

<p>Three times M. Deslon repeated the same thing, and
rather impatiently the last time.</p>

<p>“Sire,” said he, “do you not hear me?”</p>

<p>“What do you wish, monsieur?” said the King, as if
starting from a reverie.</p>

<p>“I ask your commands for M. de Bouillé, sire!”</p>

<p>“I have no more commands to give, monsieur—I am a
prisoner.”</p>

<p>“But, at least, sir—”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_183"></a>[183]</span></p>

<p>“That he does what he can for me.”</p>

<p>M. Deslon retired, without being able to obtain another
answer.</p>

<p>In fact, the King was indeed a prisoner.</p>

<p>The tocsin had completed its dismal task. Every village
had sent its contingent. Four or five thousand men
encumbered the streets of Varennes.</p>

<p>About seven in the morning, two men arriving by the
Clermont road, and bestriding horses flecked with foam,
pushed their way through the multitude.</p>

<p>The shouts of the people announced something new to
the King.</p>

<p>Soon the door opened, and admitted an officer of the National
Guard.</p>

<p>It was the same Rayon, who, whilst snatching a moment’s
rest at Châlons, sent on an express to St. Menehould.</p>

<p>He entered the royal chamber fatigued, excited, almost
mad, without a cravat, and with his hair unpowdered.</p>

<p>“Ah, sire,” said he, in a hoarse voice—“our wives, our
children! They slaughter them at Paris, sire; you will
not go much further. The interest of the State—”</p>

<p>And he fell, almost fainting, into an arm-chair.</p>

<p>“Well, sir,” said the Queen, taking his hand, and showing
him the Dauphin and Madame Royale sleeping on the
bed, “am I not a mother, too?”</p>

<p>“In short, sir,” said the King, “what have you to announce
to me?”</p>

<p>“Sire, a decree of the Assembly.”</p>

<p>“Where is it?”</p>

<p>“My comrade has it.”</p>

<p>“Your comrade?”</p>

<p>The officer made a sign to open the door.</p>

<p>One of the <span lang="fr">gardes du corps</span> opened it, and they saw M.
de Romeuf leaning against the window of the ante-chamber,
and weeping.</p>

<p>He came forward, with downcast eyes.</p>

<p>The Queen started at sight of him.</p>

<p>It was the same young man who had accompanied
M. Lafayette in the visit he had paid the King just a quarter
of an hour before he started.</p>

<p>“Ah, monsieur! is it you?” said the Queen. “I could
never have believed it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_184"></a>[184]</span></p>

<p>It was she who should have blushed before him, and she
tried to make him blush.</p>

<p>M. de Romeuf held in his hands the decree of the Assembly.</p>

<p>The King snatched it from him, cast his eyes over it, and
cried, “There is no longer a King in France!”</p>

<p>The Queen took it in her turn, read it, and returned it to
the King.</p>

<p>The King re-read it, and then placed it on the bed where
his children slept.</p>

<p>“No—no!” cried the Queen, exasperated, furious, mad
with hate and anger; “I do not wish that infamous paper
to defile my children.”</p>

<p>“Madame,” at last said Romeuf, “you have just reproached
me for being charged with this mission. Is it
not better that I should have undertaken the task than one
who would have borne witness with regard to transports of
passion?”</p>

<p>There was, in fact, at this action of the Queen’s, a terrible
murmur among the spectators.</p>

<p>The Queen had crumpled up the decree, and dashed it on
the floor.</p>

<p>M. de Choiseul, who had regained his liberty, and who,
at the moment, entered the chamber, accompanied by two
messengers, picked up the decree, and placed it on the
table.</p>

<p>The Queen appreciated his intention, and thanked him
with a look.</p>

<p>“At least, sir,” said she, addressing M. de Romeuf, “I
hope that you will do all you can for M. de Choiseul, M. de
Damas, and M. de Goguelot when we are gone.”</p>

<p>In fact, the Queen well understood that go she must.</p>

<p>It was seven o’clock in the morning, and M. de Bouillé
had not put in an appearance.</p>

<p>The peasants of the villages round Varennes continued
to pour into the town, armed with guns, pitchforks, and
scythes, and each cried louder than the other, “To Paris!
to Paris!”</p>

<p>The carriage was in readiness.</p>

<p>The King made the most of each little obstacle, counting
each moment, awaiting Bouillé.</p>

<p>At last, it was necessary to make a move.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_185"></a>[185]</span></p>

<p>The King rose first.</p>

<p>The Queen followed his example.</p>

<p>One of her women—whether naturally, or whether as an
artifice, to gain time—fainted.</p>

<p>“They may cut me into pieces if they will,” said the
Queen, “but I will not leave without one who has the
misfortune to be my friend.”</p>

<p>“As you will—stay if you like,” said a man of the
people, “At any rate, I will take the Dauphin.”</p>

<p>He took the royal child in his arms, and stepped towards
the door.</p>

<p>The Queen seized the Dauphin from him, and descended
the stairs, blushing.</p>

<p>All the family were filled with poignant anxiety. On
arriving in the street, Madame Elizabeth perceived that
half of the Queen’s hair had turned gray; the other half
was to grow gray at the Conciergerie in a second night of
agony, which was not, perhaps, more terrible than that
which we have recounted.</p>

<p>They got into the carriage; the three <span lang="fr">gardes du corps</span>
mounted on the box.</p>

<p>M. de Goguelot, in the hope of bringing succor, had
found means of escaping through the little passage situate
at the back of the house of M. Sauce.</p>

<p>M. de Choiseul and M. de Damas were conducted to the
city prison, where M. de Romeuf caused himself to be
imprisoned with them, for the sake of protecting them
more efficiently.</p>

<p>At last, after having exhausted every possible means of
delay, the carriage started, escorted by the National Guard,
under the command of M. Signemont, by the hussars of
M. de Choiseul, which had been sent to protect his flight,
and by more than four thousand citizens of Varennes and
its suburbs, armed with guns, pitchforks, and scythes.</p>

<p>The carriage of the King did not, as some historians say,
pass the house of the grocer, Sauce; that was the historical
limit of the fatal journey.</p>

<p>The moment that the carriage moved, I felt great doubt—or,
rather, great remorse.</p>

<p>The catastrophe of the arrest of the King had brought
in its train an event which, though I have but mentioned
it in the place it occupied relatively to that arrest, influenced
in a strange manner the whole of my life.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_186"></a>[186]</span></p>

<p>One can readily understand that I speak of M. de Malmy’s
wound; of the impression that that wound produced
on Mdlle. Sophie, and of the involuntary avowal that, on
her part, she had made to me.</p>

<p>I had a deep affection for Sophie. This affection, more
than fraternal, had a spice of jealousy in it; although I
must do the poor girl the justice to say that from the
moment that she perceived my nascent love, she had done
all she could to nip it in the bud, by telling me that she
could never be anything more than a sister to me. I
always had the suspicion—I will not say that my rival, for
there was no real rivalry, was M. de Malmy.</p>

<p>This time I could no longer doubt it, and I felt it impossible
to remain under the same roof with him. Not only
because Sophie loved him and he loved Sophie, but because
I knew that he was the origin of all the misery and unhappiness
that was gradually wearing her away.</p>

<p>As soon as I saw the King ready to set out, and the carriage
about to move on to Paris, I bade adieu to M. Gerbaut,
without telling him that I did not think of returning
to Varennes, and started off without having the courage to
see Sophie, whom however, I unexpectedly found in my
road, barring up the corridor.</p>

<p>“What, Mdlle. Sophie!”</p>

<p>She threw herself, weeping, on to my neck.</p>

<p>“Each one has his destiny, my good Réné,” said she.
“Mine is to suffer. I shall accomplish it.”</p>

<p>“Shall I always be your brother?” asked I, weeping
myself.</p>

<p>“Ah, yes! And if ever I have need of you, I will show
you that I am your sister, by coming to you for assistance.”</p>

<p>“Heaven guard you, Mdlle. Sophie,” cried I, withdrawing
myself from her embrace.</p>

<p>“And you, also—heaven bless you, Réné!”</p>

<p>And I heard the sobs which followed these words even as
far as the door which opened into the street.</p>

<p>I took my place at the door of the King’s carriage, making
a signal to MM. Drouet and Guillaume, who were on
horseback, with the intention of preceding the carriages, in
order to make way for, and protect them.</p>

<p>What was M. de Bouillé doing at this time? We will
tell you in the following chapter.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXXII">CHAPTER XXXII.<br>
<span class="fs70">WHAT M. DE BOUILLE DID IN THE MEANTIME.</span></h2>


<p>M. de Bouillé was at Dun, where he had passed the
night in a state of mortal disquietude.</p>

<p>It was the advanced post of his watch.</p>

<p>At three o’clock, having received no news, he proceeded to
Stenay.</p>

<p>At Stenay he was in the centre of his forces, and was
able to act with greater facility, having at his disposal a
great number of men.</p>

<p>From four to five o’clock he was successively joined by
M. de Rohrig, M. de Raigecourt, and by his son.</p>

<p>He then knew all.</p>

<p>But M. de Bouillé could but little depend on his men.
He was surrounded by hostile villagers, as he called them—that
is to say, patriotic. He was menaced by Metz, by
Verdun, and by Stenay. It was his fear of Stenay that
had caused him to quit Dun.</p>

<p>The Royal German was the sole regiment on which he
could depend. It was necessary to keep up their loyalty.</p>

<p>M. de Bouillé and his son Louis sat themselves to the
work body and soul.</p>

<p>A bottle of wine and a louis per man settled the affair.</p>

<p>But it took two hours to arm and set out.</p>

<p>At last, he started; but at seven o’clock, just at the time
when the King got into the carriage.</p>

<p>In two hours he covered the eight leagues which separated
him from Varennes.</p>

<p>On the road he met a hussar.</p>

<p>“Well?”</p>

<p>“The King is arrested.”</p>

<p>“We know it. What then?”</p>

<p>“He has just set out from Varennes.”</p>

<p>“Where goes he?”</p>

<p>“To Paris.”</p>

<p>Bouillé did not give himself time to reply.</p>

<p>He dashed his spurs into the flanks of his horse.</p>

<p>His regiment followed him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_188"></a>[188]</span></p>

<p>Varennes saw the regiment descend “like a waterspout
amongst its vines,” to quote the language of the <i lang="fr">proces
verbal</i>.</p>

<p>When he arrived at the <span lang="fr">Place du Grand Monarque</span>, the
King had started more than an hour.</p>

<p>He acted so as to lose no time. The <span lang="fr">Rue de l’Hôpital</span>
was barricaded; the bridge was barricaded. They made a
detour round the town; they crossed the river by the ford
at the Boucheries, in order to take up a favorable position
on the Clermont road, to attack the escort.</p>

<p>The order was given, and the manœuvre accomplished.</p>

<p>The river was crossed.</p>

<p>A hundred steps more, and they would be on the road.</p>

<p>But the Moulin Canal was on their way—six feet deep,
and impossible to ford.</p>

<p>It was necessary to stop and march back.</p>

<p>For an instant, they held the idea of fording the river at
St. Gengoulf, taking the Rue St. Jean, passing through
Varennes and falling on the rear of the escort.</p>

<p>But the dragoons were fatigued; the horses rebelled at
every step. It would be necessary to fight a way through
Varennes, and to fight to get to the King.</p>

<p>They said that the garrison of Verdun were on the
march, with some cannon.</p>

<p>Their courage failed them. They felt that all was lost.</p>

<p>M. de Bouillé, weeping with rage, dashed his sword into
its sheath, and ordered a retreat.</p>

<p>The inhabitants of the high town saw him and his men
standing there for an hour, unable to make up their minds
to return.</p>

<p>Eventually he and his men took the route to Dun, and
disappeared in the distance.</p>

<p>The King continued his way—<em>the way of the Cross</em>.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>After the arrest of M. Dandoins and his lieutenant, an
officer of the National Guard, Citizen Legay, had established
under the trees at the angle of the <span lang="fr">Rue de la Post
au Bois</span> and the <span lang="fr">Rue du Marais</span> a post of National Guards,
picked men, and all ordered to fire on any one entering or
leaving the city at a gallop, without responding to the challenge
of the sentinels.</p>

<p>Some minutes after these orders had been given, a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_189"></a>[189]</span>
report was circulated that the hussars of Pont-de-Somme-Vesles
had gone round the town, and that Drouet and
Guillaume ran a great risk of falling into their hands.</p>

<p>M. Legay then asked for two volunteers to go with him
on the road, and pick up what information they could with
regard to Drouet and Guillaume.</p>

<p>Two gendarmes, Collet and Pointe, offered themselves,
and all three set out on their voyage of discovery.</p>

<p>On the road they met the two citizens of St. Menehould,
who had started on sorry hacks, and been unable to keep
up the chase. They learnt from them that no accident had
happened to the two messengers. Anxious to be the bearers
of this good news, they put their horses to the gallop,
and, forgetting the orders given by Legay, omitted to
answer the challenge of the sentinels in ambuscade.</p>

<p>The sentinels fired. Two of the horsemen fell; one
dead, and the other wounded.</p>

<p>Legay received five or six shots in the arm and hand.</p>

<p>The same day that the King repassed St. Menehould, the
slain gendarme was buried.</p>

<p>The King, on arriving, found the church hung with black,
and the whole town prepared to follow the body to its last
home.</p>


<div class="chapter"></div>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXXIII">CHAPTER XXXIII.<br>
<span class="fs70">AN OLD ACQUAINTANCE TURNS UP.</span></h2>


<p>Nothing important passed between Varennes and St.
Menehould. The illustrious prisoners, starting at every
new noise, lost in a measure, as they approached the latter
town, every hope of succor.</p>

<p>The first thing they encountered was a sort of rebuke
from the dead. Of course, I allude to the interment of the
man shot in the evening by the sentinels.</p>

<p>The royal carriages stopped in order to allow the funeral
procession to pass. Two kings found themselves face to
face with each other—a living majesty and the King of
Death. The living King recognised the power of King
Death, and bowed down before him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_190"></a>[190]</span></p>

<p>St. Menehould was crowded. The National Guard poured
in from all points, those from Châlons coming in public
or private vehicles. In fact, the affluence of people was
such that they feared a lack of provisions.</p>

<p>In the midst of all these people coming and going, I recognised,
mounted on a little pony, M. Dampierre, our old
chasseur of the Forest of Argonne. He knew me, and
came to me, trying to force the line of guards on duty at
the side of the gates.</p>

<p>It was I who repulsed him, because he did not count on
my resistance.</p>

<p>“Pardon, M. le Comte,” said I; “you cannot pass!”</p>

<p>“Why can I not pass?” asked he.</p>

<p>“Because it is ordered that none shall be allowed to approach
the King’s carriage.”</p>

<p>“Who gave that order?”</p>

<p>“Our Captain, M. Drouet.”</p>

<p>“A revolutionist!”</p>

<p>“Possibly so, M. le Comte; but he is our commander, and
we are bound to obey him.”</p>

<p>“Is it forbidden to cry ‘<span lang="fr">Vive le Roi?</span>’”</p>

<p>“No, M. le Comte; we are all Royalists.”</p>

<p>M. de Dampierre lifted his hat as high as his length of
arm would permit him, raised himself in his stirrups, and
cried “<span lang="fr">Vive le Roi!</span>”</p>

<p>The King put his head out of the window, and without
any expression of gratitude or remembrance, bowed to him.</p>

<p>M. de Dampierre retreated out of the crowd with trouble,
being obliged to make his horse go backwards. I remember
him as well as if the events occurred but yesterday.
He wore gray trousers, long riding boots, a white waistcoat,
a three-cornered hat, trimmed with gold lace. As usual
with him, he carried, slung over his shoulder, a little single-barrelled
gun.</p>

<p>I lost sight of him. I fancied that he took the direction
of the <span lang="fr">Rue de l’Abreuvoir</span>.</p>

<p>During this time, the Mayor and members of the municipality
had advanced as far as the bridge of the Aisne, situate
at the extremity of the Porte au Bois, to meet the
royal family.</p>

<p>A municipal officer then took occasion to speak, and to
tell the King what alarms his flight had caused in France.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_191"></a>[191]</span></p>

<p>Louis XVI was contented to reply, with an ill-tempered
air, “I never intended to leave my kingdom.”</p>

<p>The crowd was so great that we took half an hour to go
five hundred yards.</p>

<p>About half-past eleven, the King mounted the steps of
the <span lang="fr">Hotel de Ville</span>, his garments covered with dust, and his
face altered and careworn.</p>

<p>The Queen dressed in black. She had changed her robe
at M. Sauce’s, and held the Dauphin by the hand.</p>

<p>Louis XVI and his children were hungry.</p>

<p>As for the Queen, in the same manner, as she cared not
to sleep, she now seemed to care not to eat.</p>

<p>A breakfast had been prepared through the forethought
of the municipal council, but as they were a long time serving
it, a gendarme named Lapointe brought some cherries
in his hat for Madame Royale.</p>

<p>The royal family had likewise need of rest.</p>

<p>The Mayor, M. Dupuis de Dammartin, offered them hospitality;
they accepted it; only M. Dupuis de Dammartin
observed to the King that it would be just as well if the
Queen and the Dauphin showed themselves to the people.</p>

<p>The King made no difficulty. He showed himself first.
Afterwards the Queen appeared in her turn, holding the
Dauphin in her arms. The window of the <span lang="fr">Hotel de Ville</span>—the
only one which had a balcony—was so narrow that
the King and Queen could not both show themselves at the
same time.</p>

<p>A municipal officer then announced to the people that the
King, being fatigued, intended to honor the citizens of St.
Menehould by sleeping within their walls.</p>

<p>The carriages had already been taken to the stables, and
the news of a halt for twenty-four hours was not less agreeable
to us, who had been marching seven or eight leagues
under a burning sun, than it was to the royal family, when
the National Guards from the adjacent towns and villages,
who filled the hotels and cafés, rushed into the place, crying
“Aristocrats! Traitors!” and saying that the royal family
were far too near the frontier to be allowed to halt.</p>

<p>In consequence, they ordered the immediate departure of
the King and his family.</p>

<p>The King, having informed himself of the cause of the
tumult, said, with his usual impassibility, “Very well; let
us go.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_192"></a>[192]</span></p>

<p>The Queen then reappeared on the balcony holding her
son by the hand. She pointed out the National Guards to
him, saying some words in a whisper.</p>

<p>An inhabitant of St. Menehould, who was at an adjoining
window, assured me that the following were the words
that she spoke. “Do you see those blue toads? It is they
who wish us to set out!”</p>

<p>It is needless to say that the National Guards wore the
blue uniform.</p>

<p>As the royal family crossed the hall of the <span lang="fr">Hotel de Ville</span>,
into which opened the door of the chapel, where the prisoners
had heard mass, the Queen perceiving the captives, distributed
among them five louis—the King ten.</p>

<p>At two o’clock the carriages started for Châlons. From
the time that the King had been recognised he took the
place of honor in the vehicle.</p>

<p>MM. de Malden, de Moustier, and de Valory, sat on the
box, but they were not strapped to it as some people have
said.</p>

<p>Not a single shout for the King, except that which Dampierre
uttered, as we have before mentioned, was used at
either his arrival or departure. The only shouts raised
were “<span lang="fr">Vive la nation!</span>” “<span lang="fr">Vivent les patriotes!</span>”</p>

<p>About nine or ten in the morning the Comte de Haus
arrived at St. Menehould, exasperated by the news of the
arrest of the King.</p>

<p>Many persons had heard him say, “The King is arrested!
We are all lost! But the King shall know that he still has
some faithful subjects!”</p>

<p>I have said that, after speaking to me, I had seen him
go round to the side of the horse-pond.</p>

<p>As the royal carriage passed, he presented arms to the
august prisoners, after the fashion of a sentinel.</p>

<p>The King recognised him, pointed him out to the Queen,
and returned his salute.</p>

<p>M. Dampierre then put his horse to a gallop, and disappeared
at the <span lang="fr">Rue de l’Abreuvoir</span> so as to get in advance of
the King’s carriage, stopped in the most public part of the
town, at the corner of the <span lang="fr">Rue de l’Abreuvoir</span>, and presented
arms afresh.</p>

<p>The King saluted him a third time.</p>

<p>Then pushing his horse through the crowd on the side
where I was, he approached the carriage.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_193"></a>[193]</span></p>

<p>It was going at this time up the Fleurion at a foot pace.</p>

<p>“Sire,” said he, “you see before you one of your most
faithful servants. My name is Duval de Dampierre, Comte
de Haus. I have married a lady of the House of Legur,
a relative of the minister of that name, and a niece of
M. d’Allonville.”</p>

<p>“All these names are known to me,” replied the King;
“and I am touched at the proof of fidelity which you give
me.”</p>

<p>This whispered conversation, after the pretence of the
Comte in presenting arms to the King on his road, was a
direct provocation to that crowd who were taking him who
had wished to escape back to Paris.</p>

<p>In the meantime the Comte had been gently pushed on
one side, and darting off, he disappeared in the distance.</p>

<p>The head of the procession reached the end of the town,
and arrived at the decline of Dammartin la Planchette.</p>

<p>As they left the city, M. de Dampierre reappeared, and
followed their route, keeping himself on the other side of the
hedge and ditch. He wished, by some means, to get on to
the top of the King’s carriage, from whence he could hold
communication with the royal party inside. These signs,
as they could easily understand them, excited defiance.</p>

<p>They believed that in the few words exchanged at the
door of the carriage, a project for a rescue had been
broached; they closed round the carriage, and the words
“Be on the alert!” circulated through the ranks of the
National Guards.</p>

<p>M. de Dampierre tried to approach the carriage once
again, and was repulsed, not only with murmurs, but with
menaces; the guards crossing their muskets across the door
to prevent his holding any communication with the King.</p>

<p>This almost insolent persistence on his part had exasperated
even the most temperate.</p>

<p>Seeing that his efforts were useless, M. de Dampierre
resolved to finish with an act of bravado.</p>

<p>Having accomplished two-thirds of the descent, at a spot
called La Grevières, M. de Dampierre called out a second
time “<span lang="fr">Vive le Roi!</span>” fired off his gun in the air, and
plunging his rowels into his steed, darted off at a gallop.</p>

<p>A wood was situated about half a league from the road.
They believed that some troops were in ambuscade there,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_194"></a>[194]</span>
and that the discharge of the gun was a preconcerted signal
for them.</p>

<p>Five or six horsemen dashed off in pursuit of M. de Dampierre;
ten or twelve shots were fired at him at the same
time, but none of the bullets touched him.</p>

<p>M. de Dampierre, still at a gallop, waved his arm in a
triumphant manner in the air.</p>

<p>I rushed off like the others, though on foot, not to capture
M. de Dampierre—heaven forbid!—but, on the contrary,
to help him if needful.</p>

<p>M. de Dampierre had already galloped more than five
hundred yards, and he had almost escaped from his pursuers,
when his horse, in leaping a ditch, stumbled, and fell.</p>

<p>But, with the aid of the bit and bridle, he managed to
raise him up again, and once more set off at a gallop. His
gun was left in the ditch.</p>

<p>At this moment a solitary gun was discharged.</p>

<p>It was fired by a peasant, mounted on a horse belonging
to one of the hussars, which he had captured the evening
before.</p>

<p>It was easy to see that M. de Dampierre was wounded.
He fell backwards on the croup of his horse, which reared.</p>

<p>Then, in a moment, with the rapidity of lightning, on
the little bridge of St. Catherine, by the borders of the
ditch, the waters of which pass under the bridge, a horrible
scene took place, which I saw in all its dreadful details, but
was unable to oppose.</p>

<p>The peasant who had fired the shot, followed by about
forty men, caught up the Comte de Haus, dealt him a blow
with his sabre, and then unhorsed him. I saw no more.
I heard the report of about twenty guns, into the suffocating
smoke of which I dashed.</p>

<p>They were firing at M. de Dampierre.</p>

<p>I arrived too late. Had I reached the mob sooner, it
would have been to have died with him, for I could not
have saved him.</p>

<p>His body was riddled with bullets, and gashed with
bayonets; his face, scratched by the peasants’ hob-nailed
boots, was unrecognisable.</p>

<p>His watch was dashed to pieces by a ball which had
penetrated his fob.</p>

<p>There was nothing to be done. I threw my gun over<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_195"></a>[195]</span>
my shoulder, and, with tears in my eyes and sweat on my
brow, I rejoined my rank.</p>

<p>The royal berlin continued its route slowly and sorrowfully
under a sweltering sun, along that unbending route
which crosses like a pencil line that sorrowful portion of
France called the Paltry Land.</p>

<span class="fs70">THE CRITICS CRITICISED.</span></h2>


<p>Not only does it seem to me sufficient to relate what I
have seen; I desire also, as an eye-witness, to rectify history
and to combat, on sure grounds, the mistake of historians.</p>

<p>In order to give a slight idea of the intense excitement
of Republican France against the King, and more particularly
against the Queen, I quote the following letter, the
original of which was sent by the citizens of Counien to the
municipal officers of Varennes:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="right">
“27th of June, 2nd year of Liberty.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Gentlemen</span>,—</p>

<p>“Allow the patriotic women of the State, who have the
honor of being members of the Club of the Society of the
Friends of the Constitution, to present to you their best
congratulations at the capture in your city of the execrable
traitors, Citizen and Citizeness Capet, whose traitorous machinations
have so long tried to crush freedom in France.
Our only prayer is that both may speedily be humiliated.
<span lang="fr">Vive la France! Vive la Liberté! A bas les Capets!</span></p>

<p class="right">
<span class="padr2">“For the Citizenesses of Counien,</span><br>
(Signed) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; “Citoyenne Marie Benoit.</p>

<p>“To the Municipal Officers of Varennes.”</p>
</div>

<p>After this specimen of the feeling of the women of France
can it be wondered that the fate of the King and Queen
seemed assured. Either they must die, or France must
sink lower than ever. This, of course, was only my opinion;
but events have proved whether I was right or wrong.</p>

<span class="fs70">IS LOVE ETERNAL?</span></h2>


<p>The route from St. Menehould to Châlons is long and
fatiguing—nine apparently never-ending leagues, traversing
flat and arid plains under a leaden sky, with a sun
darting his scorching rays with reflected lustre on the
musket barrels and sword blades.</p>

<p>The royal family arrived at Châlons fatigued, dispirited
and worn out, at ten in the evening.</p>

<p>Half the original followers of the royal escort had thrown
themselves down under hedges and in ditches, unable any
longer to proceed.</p>

<p>But the actual escort was as strong on arriving at
Châlons as when leaving St. Menehould, since it was recruited
by the National Guard of every village through
which it passed; and the villages were pretty thickly
scattered on the right and left of that road.</p>

<p>The authorities, of whom the Mayor took the lead, conducted
the prisoners to the gate of the Dauphin. I use
the word prisoners advisedly, as the royal family were in
fact, at that time, prisoners of the nation.</p>

<p>Strange coincidence!—the gate through which they
passed was the triumphal arch raised by the French people
in commemoration of the entry of Madame the Dauphine
into France.</p>

<p>It still bore the inscription, “<em>May it stand eternal like
our love</em>.”</p>

<p>The arch, in fact, still stood, but the love which prompted
it had fallen away.</p>

<p>At Châlons, especially, opinion changes.</p>

<p>The bluffness of the national party was lessened. The
old town where Attila lost himself, and which now preserved
its trade only in the wines of Champagne, was inhabited
by Royalists of the better class, and by poor
gentlemen. These good people were sorely vexed to see
their unhappy King in such doleful plight.</p>

<p>They expected his arrival; consequently a great supper
was prepared.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_197"></a>[197]</span></p>

<p>The King and Queen partook of the meal in public, as
they did at Varennes. A sort of royal drawing-room was
held. The ladies bore with them immense bouquets. The
Queen was positively overwhelmed with flowers.</p>

<p>They determined to start on the morrow, feeling an increase
of confidence on account of the reception they had
met with.</p>

<p>Before they set out, mass was celebrated at ten
o’clock by M. Charber, perpetual-curate of Notre Dame.
The King was present, accompanied by the Queen and
the royal family; but hardly had the solemn service commenced,
before a disturbance was made.</p>

<p>It was the National Guard of Rheims, who wished the
King to set out at once. The time spent in mass appeared
to them wasted, as they had come solely to gloat over the
downfall of monarchy, and the ruin of their King. They
broke open, therefore, the doors of the chapel, despite the
resistance offered to them by the National Guard.</p>

<p>The King and Queen were advised to show themselves
at the balcony. They did so; but the sight of their
august persons exasperated, in place of calming, the turbulence
of the excited populace, who shouted for the royal
family to leave their city, and actually drew the carriages
to the door, harnessed the horses, and did, in fact, all they
could do to accelerate the departure of the King.</p>

<p>The King appeared again at the balcony, and pronounced
the following words:—</p>

<p>“Since you oblige me to leave you, I go!”</p>

<p>Although this was a reproach more than anything else, it
satisfied the people.</p>

<p>At eleven exactly, the royal family re-entered their carriage,
and put themselves <i lang="fr">en route</i>.</p>

<p>The heat was dreadfully oppressive. Their journey was
made, as it were, through a blast furnace, and their eyes
were incessantly tormented by a penetrating dust.</p>

<p>I happened to know the situation of a cool spring. I approached
the royal carriage, and demanded respectfully of
her Majesty the Queen if she desired a glass of fresh water,
as we were near to some of a most excellent quality.</p>

<p>“Thank you,” replied the Queen.</p>

<p>“Oh, do have some, mamma—do have some! I am so
thirsty!” said the Dauphin.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_198"></a>[198]</span></p>

<p>“I wish it not; but give me some for my children,” said
the Queen.</p>

<p>Madame de Tourzel handed me a silver cup.</p>

<p>“Fill this up for me, also,” said Madame Elizabeth.</p>

<p>She handed me another cup.</p>

<p>In fancy, after a lapse of sixty years, I can still see her
angelic face—still hear that charming voice, whose entreaties
were more than commands.</p>

<p>I leant my gun against the trunk of a tree, rushed to
the fountain, and brought back the two cups filled with the
sparkling water, which, through my rapidity, had not had
time to lose its freshness.</p>

<p>The Dauphin and Madame Royale shared one cup between
them.</p>

<p>Madame Elizabeth, after offering the other cup to the
Queen, who refused it, drank it herself.</p>

<p>“Oh, what delicious water it is,” cried the Dauphin.
“Why does the world drink aught else?”</p>

<p>“Because they have drinks they like better,” replied the
King.</p>

<p>“My son thanks you, sir,” said the Queen.</p>

<p>“I also thank you,” said Madame Elizabeth, with her
sweet smile.</p>

<p>I seized my gun, which had been left at the foot of a
tree.</p>

<p>“I saw you once run after M. de Dampierre,” said the
Queen. “With what intention?”</p>

<p>“With the hope of saving him, if possible, madame.”</p>

<p>“You have the same opinions, then, as M. de Dampierre,”
said the Queen.</p>

<p>“I agree with him in the respect which he feels towards
your enemies.”</p>

<p>“Do you know that you give an ambiguous answer,
young man?” said the King.</p>

<p>“Yes, sire,” I replied.</p>

<p>“Ha, ha!” said he.</p>

<p>Then to the Queen: “The minds of these people are
poisoned against us, from their very childhood.”</p>

<p>“Oh, papa!” cried the Dauphin, “what a beautiful gun
he has!”</p>

<p>I was the person referred to. To the Queen and
Madame Elizabeth I was “monsieur,” but to the Dauphin
I was simply “he.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_199"></a>[199]</span></p>

<p>The King looked at my gun.</p>

<p>“It is,” said he, “a gun manufactured at Versailles.
Where did you procure it?”</p>

<p>“The Duc d’Enghien gave it to me, sire.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said the King, “the Condés have all the benefits
on this side,—‘the department of the Meuse,’ as they call
it.”</p>

<p>Then looking towards me: “Have you ever served
princes?”</p>

<p>“Sire,” said I, smiling, “is it necessary to have served
princes in order to receive a present from them?”</p>

<p>The Queen bent her regards upon the King.</p>

<p>“Strange!” said she.</p>

<p>I retreated a pace.</p>

<p>The King beckoned me, but not knowing how to address
me, he said, “My young friend, you say that the Duc d’Enghien
gave you that gun?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sire. I understand,” said I, “that the King
wishes to know upon what occasion this gun was presented
to me. I was the nephew of a park-keeper of the Forest
of Argonne, whose name was Father Descharmes. The
Duc de Condé and the Duc d’Enghien often hunted in this
forest. The Duc d’Enghien took a fancy to me, and gave
me this gun.”</p>

<p>The King, for a moment, appeared buried in thought.</p>

<p>“Your uncle is still alive?” he then asked.</p>

<p>“Sire, he is dead?”</p>

<p>“Why do you not solicit his place?”</p>

<p>“Because, sire, the keepers wear livery. I am a free
man.”</p>

<p>“Children suck in republican ideas, even with their mothers’
milk!” murmured the King.</p>

<p>He then threw himself back in his carriage.</p>

<p>I know not if the King spoke again; but the carriage at
the moment stopped; and, perchance, with it stopped something
of importance.</p>

<p>We had arrived at Port Bassion.</p>

<p>Suddenly was heard a cry: “The commissaires! the
commissaires!”</p>

<p>At this moment, a man on horseback dashed up to the
door of the King’s carriage. The King put out his head,
to see what had caused the halt.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_200"></a>[200]</span></p>

<p>“Sire,” said the horseman, “here are three deputies,
who wish to direct the return of your Majesty.”</p>

<p>“Aha!” said the King, “Can you tell me the names of
these estimable gentlemen?”</p>

<p>“Their names, sire, are Citizens Latour-Maubourg, Barnave,
and Pétion.”</p>

<p>The three deputies represented the three different parties
of the Assembly. Latour-Maubourg was Royalist, Barnave
was Constitutional, Pétion was Republican.</p>

<p>The crowd respectfully drew back. Three men approached
the royal carriage, stopped at the door, and saluted the
King, who returned their inclination.</p>

<p>One of them held in his hand a paper, which he read in
a loud voice. It was the decree of the National Assembly.</p>

<p>The man who read it was Pétion.</p>

<p>This decree ordered them to proceed to the King, not only
to ensure his safety, but also as a mark of respect due to
royalty, as represented in the persons of Louis XVI and
Marie Antoinette.</p>

<p>The King knew that M. Latour-Maubourg was a Royalist.</p>

<p>He therefore desired that, as two deputies had to sit in
the carriage with him, he would name the two. The
Queen expressed the same desire.</p>

<p>M. Latour-Maubourg replied, in a whisper:—</p>

<p>“I accepted the sad mission which introduces me to your
Majesty only in the hopes of being of some service to you.
Your Majesty can, then, count upon me as a faithful follower.
But I have not the power of Barnave, who exercises
an enormous influence over the Assembly. He is vain as
an advocate, and will be flattered by having a seat in the
carriage of the King. It is, therefore, needful that he
should occupy a place, and that the Queen should take the
opportunity of improving his acquaintance. I, therefore,
beg your Majesties to excuse my surrendering my seat.”</p>

<p>The Queen bowed her head. She wished to again assume
her womanly properties, and to seduce Barnave, as
she had Mirabeau. To be sure, it was humiliating, but, at
the same time, it was a distraction.</p>

<p>Strange contradiction! It was the King who had most
repugnance to Barnave’s occupying a seat in the royal carriage.
Barnave, a little Dauphinois advocate, pride upon<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_201"></a>[201]</span>
his face, his nose perked up in the air, and his <i lang="fr">tout ensemble</i>
proclaiming insufferable conceit, took his place. Pétion
likewise, his rosy cheeks glowing with satisfaction, disposed
of himself to his perfect content.</p>

<p>Barnave and Pétion, therefore, as we have said, entered
the royal carriage.</p>

<p>Madame de Tourzel had resigned her place, and entered,
with M. Latour-Maubourg, the carriage set apart for the
attendants.</p>

<p>Pétion at once proclaimed his discourtesy by claiming, as
representative of the National Assembly, a seat with his
face to the horses. The King and Queen made a sign to
Madame Elizabeth, who at once changed places with him.</p>

<p>At last, all inside the royal carriage were satisfactorily
arranged. On the back seat were the King, Pétion, the
Queen; and on the front, Madame Elizabeth, face to face
with Pétion, Madame Royale and the Dauphin face to face
and knee to knee with the Queen, who was opposite, also,
to Barnave.</p>

<p>At the first glance the Queen fancied that Barnave was
dry, cold, and wicked.</p>

<p>Barnave had hoped to take the place of Mirabeau at the
Assembly. He had succeeded in part; could not the Queen
confer the rest?</p>

<p>Why not?</p>

<p>Had she not, at St. Cloud, given a secret interview to
Mirabeau? Why should not he, Barnave, be accorded a
similar favor.</p>

<p>But then, public rumor spread abroad that one of the
three gentlemen on the box of the carriage, “M. Fersen,”
was the accepted lover of the Queen.</p>

<p>Strange thing! As I have told you the good self-opinion
of Barnave, he was yet jealous of M. de Fersen.</p>

<p>With the admirable shrewdness of women, the Queen
discovered this before a quarter of an hour had elapsed.</p>

<p>She managed to get the three guards, named respectively
MM. de Malden, de Valory, and de Moustier.</p>

<p>No Fersen!</p>

<p>Barnave breathed, smiled, and became positively charming.</p>

<p>Barnave was young, handsome, polished, of fascinating
manners, and felt great commiseration for the unfortunate
royal party.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_202"></a>[202]</span></p>

<p>In place of the Queen seducing Barnave, Barnave
almost seduced the Queen.</p>

<span class="fs70">BARNAVE AND PETION.</span></h2>


<p>One naturally asks how I became acquainted with all
this.</p>

<p>I have already said that, on leaving Varennes, I had
taken a place on the back of the carriage of the King.
Happily, I had managed to retain my position, despite the
heat, the fatigue, and the dust. Twice only, for a few minutes,
had I quitted my location; firstly, to try and assist
M. de Dampierre, and, secondly, to procure the water for
Madame Elizabeth and the Dauphin. Both times, on my
return, I recovered my place. The glass windows of the
berlin were let down on account of the heat, and the royal
family, not speaking in very low voices, I managed to hear
pretty well all that was said.</p>

<p>This explanation given, I will continue my story, with
the history of the rudeness of Pétion, and the courtesy of
Barnave.</p>

<p>There was placed between Madame Elizabeth and
Madame Royale, a bottle of lemonade and a glass. Pétion
was thirsty, and felt inclined to drink. He took the glass,
and handed it to Madame Elizabeth, who took up the lemonade,
and filled it.</p>

<p>“Enough!” said Pétion, lifting his glass as he would
have done at a cabaret.</p>

<p>The Queen’s eyes flashed with anger.</p>

<p>The Dauphin, with the impatience of a youngster, shifted
in his seat; Pétion seized him, and imprisoned him
between his legs.</p>

<p>The Queen said nothing, but again darted a look of
menace at Pétion; who, remembering that it might be
politic to gain the favor of the King, caressed the Dauphin’s
white locks with apparent affection.</p>

<p>The Dauphin made a grimace expressive of grief.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_203"></a>[203]</span></p>

<p>The Queen snatched him from Pétion’s legs.</p>

<p>Barnave, smiling, immediately opened his arms to him.</p>

<p>The boy seemed willing, and was, therefore, soon installed
on Barnave’s knees.</p>

<p>His instinct shewed him that he would find in Barnave
a protector.</p>

<p>Playing with a button on the coat of the representative,
he discovered that a device was inscribed upon it, and, after
many efforts, succeeded in reading it.</p>

<p>The device was, “Live free, or die.”</p>

<p>The Queen sighed, and regarded Barnave, her eyes filled
with tears.</p>

<p>Barnave’s heart smote him.</p>

<p>This was his position. He followed his own individual
romance in the midst of a royal and terrible history, when
suddenly a noise was heard some paces behind the royal
carriage.</p>

<p>The cries and tumult drew Barnave from the magic circle
which surrounded him.</p>

<p>A venerable ecclesiastic approached the carriage, much in
the same manner as M. de Dampierre had done, and uplifted
his hands and blessed the royal martyr.</p>

<p>The mob, unsatiated by one murder, rushed upon the
priest, and drew him away, to slaughter him in the ditch
by the roadside.</p>

<p>I was on the opposite side of the carriage to where this
affair was taking place.</p>

<p>“M. Barnave, M. Barnave!” cried I; “help, help!”</p>

<p>At the same moment, M. Barnave, putting his head out
of the window, saw what was taking place.</p>

<p>He placed the Dauphin in the arms of his aunt, and
opened the carriage door with such violence and rapidity,
that he almost fell out; in fact, he would have fallen, had
not Madame Elizabeth caught and retained him by his
coat-tails.</p>

<p>“Oh, Frenchmen!” cried he; “ye are a nation of brave
men—would ye become a horde of assassins?”</p>

<p>At this eloquent appeal, the people let go the priest, who
escaped, protected by the outspread arms and eloquent gestures
of Barnave.</p>

<p>The door was again shut, Barnave retook his place, and
the Queen said to him, “I thank you, M. Barnave.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_204"></a>[204]</span></p>

<p>He bowed his head.</p>

<p>Before the arrival of the commissaires, the King had
eaten alone with his family; but now, after consulting the
Queen, he invited them to share his repast.</p>

<p>Pétion accepted the invitation; Latour-Maubourg and
Barnave declined.</p>

<p>Barnave insisted, however, on waiting on the royal family;
but the Queen made him a sign, and he yielded.</p>

<p>I was one of the guard at the door of the dining-room.</p>

<p>In the evening, MM. Drouet and Guillaume set out at
full speed, to inform the Assembly of what had taken
place.</p>

<p>Drouet came to bid me good-bye.</p>

<p>“M. Drouet,” said I to him, “you know me, as I am
your pupil. I take the greatest interest in that which is
going on. It will be something to talk about for the rest
of my life. Give the order, before you leave, to have me
always placed close to their Majesties. The fatigue will be
nothing, and I wish to see all that goes on.”</p>

<p>“Be it as you wish,” said he, without making the least
objection.</p>

<p>That was the reason why I had been appointed one of
the guards that day at the door of the dining-room.</p>

<p>This is what happened at Dormans.</p>

<p>After dinner, the three commissaires went into the
neighboring room—that is to say, the one at which I
mounted guard.</p>

<p>“Citizens,” said Barnave to them, “we are commissaires
of the National Assembly, and not the executioners of the
royal family; and to make them proceed under this burning
sun is simply to conduct them to the scaffold.”</p>

<p>“Good!” said Pétion. “What has happened to them
has been brought on by their own follies.”</p>

<p>“Still they are no less King and Queen,” replied M. de
Latour-Maubourg.</p>

<p>“If affairs keep progressing as they do now, it is
extremely probable that they will not long even have that
title to console them.”</p>

<p>“Quite right,” said Barnave. “But still I think that,
as long as they retain the titles of King and Queen, they
ought to be treated as such.”</p>

<p>“I have no objection,” said Pétion, in an indifferent
tone. “Do as you like, most loyal gentlemen.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_205"></a>[205]</span></p>

<p>Saying these words, he left the room.</p>

<p>Barnave and M. de Latour-Maubourg, being alone,
decided that the royal carriage should be accompanied only
by a cavalry escort, so that it might proceed at a trot, and
on the third evening arrive at Meaux.</p>

<p>At that moment, they relieved guard. I ran to the
postmaster at Dormans, who was a friend of M. Drouet’s,
and with whom we had lodged on our way to the federation,
and prayed him to lend me a horse, to go as far as Meaux,
where the royal family would halt, to pass the night in
repose.</p>

<p>In these critical times, paternal feeling elevated itself.
The postmaster had seen M. Drouet the evening before,
who had announced to him my arrival to-day. He would
not let me hire the steed—he gave it to me.</p>

<p>They arrived at Meaux about six in the evening.</p>

<p>The King again invited the commissaires to sup with
him, as he had before invited them to dine. Pétion
accepted the invitation; M. de Latour-Maubourg and Barnave
refused it.</p>

<p>But the Queen, with charming grace, turning towards
Barnave, said, “Pray accept it, M. Barnave, as, after the
meal, I shall have need of you.”</p>

<p>Barnave bowed, the King signed to M. de Latour-Maubourg
and the two took their places at the royal table.</p>

<p>They were located in the palace of the Bishop of Meaux,
a melancholy-looking place enough, with its dark oak staircase
and mysterious and dusty passages.</p>

<p>I was on guard at the garden gate.</p>

<p>After dinner, the Queen, who, as she had said to Barnave,
had need of him, took his arm, and mounted the staircase
to the apartments above, under pretext of seeing a chamber
once occupied by Bossuet.</p>

<p>As for the King, he descended into the gardens with
Pétion. Pétion it was who desired the <i lang="fr">tête-à-tête</i>.</p>

<p>Pétion, who, apart from his folly, was a good man, and
had a good heart, had formed an idea of escape for the King.
It was, to allow the three body-guards to go, so that they
might disguise themselves as National Guards, and so facilitate
their entrance into Paris.</p>

<p>But, extraordinary to relate, the King could not understand
this idea of Pétion’s; and not wishing to be under<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_206"></a>[206]</span>
an obligation to Pétion, and having the absurd suspicion
that he wished to assassinate the guards, he refused.</p>

<p>And yet, on the day when he could have caused Lafayette
to be proclaimed Mayor of Paris, he nominated Pétion.</p>

<p>It was because the Queen hated Lafayette more than the
King detested Pétion.</p>

<p>As for the Queen, no one knows what passed between her
and Barnave, except through the account which she afterwards
gave to Madame Campan.</p>

<p>The impression which the young representative produced
on the Queen may be summed up in those words.</p>

<p>“If ever power returns into our hands, the pardon of
Barnave is assured in our hearts.”</p>

<p>The Queen was ready to pardon Barnave for his rebellion;
France did not pardon him for his weakness.</p>

<p>The unhappy orator paid with his head for the few
moments of happiness he spent with this second Marie
Stuart.</p>

<p>Perchance he had the same honor as Mirabeau, of kissing
her hand.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXXVII">CHAPTER XXXVII.<br>
<span class="fs70">PARIS.</span></h2>


<p>Day dawned.</p>

<p>It was the 25th of June. They returned to Paris after
five days absence.</p>

<p>Five days! What terrible events had come to pass in
the space of five days!</p>

<p>As they approached Paris, Barnave retook his seat at the
back.</p>

<p>No longer was it a seat of honor, but the place of
danger.</p>

<p>If a fanatic should fire on the King, which was, indeed,
probable; if on the Queen, which was more than probable;—Barnave
was there, to arrest with his own body the fell
bullet aimed at royalty.</p>

<p>M. Mathieu Damas had been charged by Lafayette,
Royalist though he was, to protect their entry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_207"></a>[207]</span></p>

<p>This able strategist had drawn from all parties in order
to diminish the danger. He confided the guarding of the
carriage to the grenadiers, whose tall hats hid entirely the
doors; a line of horse grenadiers formed a second ring.</p>

<p>As for the three guards whom Louis XVI had not wished
to go, two grenadiers, with their muskets bayoneted, sat a
little behind the box-seat, ready to suppress any attempt at
rescue or flight.</p>

<p>The heat was tremendous. The carriage, the nearer it
approached Paris, appeared to be entering the mouth of
a furnace.</p>

<p>The Queen, whom nothing hitherto had conquered, was
beaten by the heat. Twice or thrice she cried, “I suffocate!”</p>

<p>At Bourget, the King asked for wine.</p>

<p>Broken down by fatigue, Madame Elizabeth slept.</p>

<p>The change of places had brought Pétion close by her.
The face of the future Mayor of Paris had a remarkable
expression of joy. The Queen, who cared not for sleeping
herself, shook her by the arm in order to awaken her.</p>

<p>“Let her alone,” cried Pétion. “Nature must take its
course.”</p>

<p>They passed the barrier, and entered into the midst of a
moving and agitated people.</p>

<p>From time to time the crowd gave a tremendous yell.
The King, trying to show <i lang="fr">sang-froid</i> began, apparently,
to read.</p>

<p>“Suppose one were to applaud the King!”</p>

<p>“He shall be scourged!”</p>

<p>“Suppose one were to insult him?”</p>

<p>“He shall be hanged!”</p>

<p>The crowd kept pace with the carriage.</p>

<p>Mathieu Damas, commanding the escort, did not wish to
enter Paris by the Faubourg St. Martin. He was nearer
the Faubourg St. Antoine, of terrible memory, on account
of the attack and seizure of the Bastille.</p>

<p>He asked himself if he had a human barrier strong
enough to protect the royal family from the crowd who
had virtually sentenced them to death. He went round
Paris by the external Boulevards, and entered it by the
Champ Elysées and the Place Louis XV.</p>

<p>On the Place Louis XV stood, at that period, the statue
of the monarch whose name the place bore.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_208"></a>[208]</span></p>

<p>They had bandaged the eyes of the statue with a handkerchief.</p>

<p>This allusion, though ignored by the King, still disquieted
him.</p>

<p>“Why this bandage on the eyes of my predecessor?” inquired
the King.</p>

<p>“To show the blindness of the monarchy, sire,” replied
Pétion.</p>

<p>In the progress from the Champs Elysées to the Place
Louis XV, the barrier of grenadiers was often broken.</p>

<p>Then the Queen saw appear at the windows hideous faces,
expressive of satisfaction and revenge.</p>

<p>What caused those devils to turn away and bow?</p>

<p>It was a kiss which the Dauphin sent them, and a bow
from his sister; those white-winged angels hovering over
the royal family.</p>

<p>Lafayette, with his etat major, passed by the Queen.</p>

<p>As soon as she perceived them, she cried out, “M. Lafayette,
above all things save my three body-guards; their
crime has been but to obey me.”</p>

<p>The same cry was uttered by her at Versailles on the 6th
of October. Their danger was really great.</p>

<p>The carriages passed through the gate of the Tuileries,
which was vainly endeavored to be shut after them. They
proceeded along the grand promenade of the garden, and
halted only at the end of the great terrace which stretched
along the front of the palace.</p>

<p>It was there that the crowd, greater than ever, awaited
them. It was impossible to go farther; they must get out
of their carriage.</p>

<p>The Assembly was not present, but it had sent twenty
deputies.</p>

<p>Lafayette cleared a pathway from the terrace to the palace
door. He constructed an iron arch with the muskets
and bayonets of the National Guard.</p>

<p>“M. Barnave,” again cried the Queen, “I ask you to
protect my three guards.”</p>

<p>The children first descended, and entered the palace without
opposition. It was then the turn of the three guards,
for whom the Queen had asked protection from M. Lafayette
and M. Barnave.</p>

<p>Then there came a terrible outcry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_209"></a>[209]</span></p>

<p>I had left my horse at the top of the Champs Elysées,
and marched with the grenadiers on foot. At first, they
tried to turn me out, but the King said, “Let him alone;
he is a friend.”</p>

<p>They did leave me alone. M. Pétion gave me a side
glance; M. Barnave smiled.</p>

<p>The King and Queen looked to see what would happen
to the three guards; the King gazed with his usual apathy,
the Queen with intense interest.</p>

<p>The sabres and pikes of the National Guard waved over
them as they shouted, “Death to the traitors!”</p>

<p>All of a sudden, I saw a stream of blood running down
M. de Malden’s cheek.</p>

<p>Being in the circle, I drew him, with a vigorous effort,
towards me, crying, “Peace! peace! I am the friend of
M. Drouet.”</p>

<p>Five hundred voices shouted, “Long live Drouet! Long
live Guillaume!”</p>

<p>I drew M. de Malden under the arch of the Grand
Pavilion, but he would proceed no farther until assured of
the safety of the King and Queen.</p>

<p>During this time, in the midst of the most terrible murmurs,
they saved M. de Valory and M. de Moustier.</p>

<p>Like M. de Malden, M. de Valory was wounded; but
also like M. de Malden, his wound was but slight.</p>

<p>At this moment, the Queen cried, in a suffocating voice,
“Help! help!”</p>

<p>In getting out of the carriage, she found herself in the
arms of two men, who regarded her with looks of mortal
enmity, and at the same time held her fast.</p>

<p>These two men were M. de Aguillon and M. de Noailles.
The Queen seemed likely to faint with terror. Both said
to her, “Fear nothing, madame; we protect you.”</p>

<p>At the peril of their lives, they conducted her to her
room. There she was seized with agony. She called the
Dauphin—she looked for the Dauphin, but no Dauphin was
there.</p>

<p>Madame Royale took her by the hand and led her into
the bed-room, and pointed out to her the Dauphin, who,
overcome with fatigue, slept.</p>

<p>She could not believe, after the threats she had heard,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_210"></a>[210]</span>
that the whole of the royal family could re-enter their
palace safe and sound.</p>

<p>I returned to the carriage, where still remained Madame
Elizabeth and the King.</p>

<p>Barnave thought that it would not be too much for him
and Pétion to safeguard the King.</p>

<p>“Some one,” cried he—“some one to offer Madame
Elizabeth an arm.”</p>

<p>Madame Elizabeth descended from the carriage with her
usual angelic calmness.</p>

<p>“Monsieur,” said she to me, “will you give me your
arm?”</p>

<p>I was frightened out of my wits.</p>

<p>“Oh, madame,” said I; “this dress?”</p>

<p>“The dress that you wear is far better than a royal robe.
And besides,” continued she, “I have watched you: you
are a young man of a good heart.”</p>

<p>I threw my gun over my shoulder, and took my hat in
my hand.</p>

<p>“Madame,” said I, “if you desire one ready to die for
you—to throw down his life in your behalf, your choice
could not fall on one better than myself.”</p>

<p>They saw Madame Elizabeth take the arm of a simple
National Guard, and they clapped their hands.</p>

<p>Arrived at the foot of the staircase, I wished to retire.</p>

<p>“My brother?” said she, trying to see.</p>

<p>I looked back.</p>

<p>“He is coming,” said I, “between M. Barnave and
M. Pétion.”</p>

<p>I then bowed to Madame Elizabeth a second time.</p>

<p>“Will you not return to see us, sir?” asked Madame
Elizabeth.</p>

<p>“I fear, madame, that I shall not again have the opportunity
of being of service to you.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps so, but you have been; and, whatever people
may say, we are a family that never forget.”</p>

<p>At this moment the King arrived.</p>

<p>“Thank you, gentlemen; thank you,” said he to Barnave
and Pétion. “I need not say to you that if you like
to come up-stairs——”</p>

<p>“Sire,” replied Barnave, “your Majesty and her Majesty<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_211"></a>[211]</span>
the Queen are at present in safety. We must go to
render an account of our mission to the Assembly.”</p>

<p>They bowed to the King, and retired.</p>

<p>I did the same; that is to say, I bowed; but as I was
retiring, Madame Elizabeth, pointing me out to the King,
said, “My brother, this young man?”</p>

<p>She evidently, in her noble heart, did not wish me to go
without some recompense.</p>

<p>“’Tis true,” said the King; “I forgot that he was your
<i lang="fr">protegé</i>.”</p>

<p>“Say, rather, that I am his <i lang="fr">protegé</i>.”</p>

<p>He took me by the collar of my coat.</p>

<p>“Look here, young man; unhappy as we are, can we do
nothing to help you?”</p>

<p>I felt wounded that the King should think that I required
to be paid for what I had done.</p>

<p>“Sire,” replied I, “if you make a promise to the nation,
keep it; and, as a citizen, you will have done all for me
that I can ask.”</p>

<p>“You see, sister,” said the King, “he is a savage.”</p>

<p>“What is your name, sir?” asked Madame Elizabeth.</p>

<p>“Réné Besson.”</p>

<p>“Whence come you?”</p>

<p>“From the Forest of Argonne.”</p>

<p>“I told you he was a savage,” said the King. “What
else could you expect?”</p>

<p>“What trade are you?”</p>

<p>“A carpenter.”</p>

<p>“My brother, you know the fable of the Lion and the
Rat,” said Madame Elizabeth.</p>

<p>“My friend,” said the King, “you see that I must enter
my house. If you have need of me, ask for Cléry, my
<i lang="fr">valet-de-chambre</i>.”</p>

<p>“Sire,” replied I, “a man who has an occupation has
need of no one, much less of a King.”</p>

<p>The King shrugged his shoulders, and mounted the staircase.
Madame Elizabeth stayed behind.</p>

<p>“But, on the other hand, my friend,” said she, “suppose
that we have need of you?”</p>

<p>“Ah, madame,” cried I, “that is another affair!”</p>

<p>“In that case, M. Réné Besson, ask for Cléry.”</p>

<p>She followed her brother, whilst I stood there motionless,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_212"></a>[212]</span>
regarding that angel who knew how to recompense one in
asking.</p>

<p>On the morrow, the journalist, Prudhomme, wrote:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Certain good patriots, in whom the sentiment of loyalty
has not extinguished that of compassion, appear
uneasy concerning the moral and physical state of Louis
XVI and his family, after a journey so fatiguing in all
respects as that from St. Menehould.</p>

<p>“Let them reassure themselves. Our friend, on entering
his apartments, on his return, felt no more fatigue than if
he had been indulging in the pleasures of the chase.</p>

<p>“He ate his chicken as usual, and the next day played
after dinner with his son.</p>

<p>“As for the mother, she took a bath on her arrival.
Her first request was for boots; she having remarked with
sorrow, that hers had been destroyed by travelling. She
acted with hauteur to the officers picked out especially to
guard her, and said that it was ridiculous and indecent to
have the door of her bath-room and bed-chamber left
open.”</p>
</div>

<p>We quote these four paragraphs to show to what an
extent party spirit can blind men.</p>

<p>The Citizen Prudhomme, who, after having written
“The Revolutions of Paris in ’91,” was to write “The
Crimes of the Revolution of ’98,” wrongfully describes four
incidents:—“That the King ate a fowl, and that he played
with his son; that the Queen had a bath, and shut her door
when taking it.”</p>

<p>It is always so. There can never be a revolution without
a Prudhomme: first, to glorify them: and then to grossly
insult.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXXVIII">CHAPTER XXXVIII.<br>
<span class="fs70">I RESUME MY ORIGINAL PROFESSION.</span></h2>


<p>It was nine o’clock in the evening. I went to look after
my horse, which I had left in a house by the barrier. They
gave it back to me as promised, and I retook it to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_213"></a>[213]</span>
stables, always using the name of M. Drouet. I took a
receipt for it, and at ten o’clock I entered the Rue St.
Honoré.</p>

<p>I found all the family at table, as, on account of the
day’s excitement, the supper, which usually was partaken
of at eight o’clock, to-night was delayed till ten.</p>

<p>They raised a cry of joy when they saw me. Maître
Duplay, who had been with the National Guard of the
Quartier St. Honoré, fancied that he saw me at the door of
the royal carriage, by the side of the grenadiers; but the
thing appeared so improbable, that he had told it to his
family more as a delusion than a fact.</p>

<p>Scarcely was I recognised, than the two girls immediately
made a space for me between them.</p>

<p>This was the more easy, as the elder apprentice was
absent, leaving only the one enamoured of Mdlle. Cornelie,
Félicién Herda.</p>

<p>I did not want much pressing to sit down; I was literally
dying of hunger and thirst. The young girls wished to
ask me questions; but M. Duplay excused me until I had
both eaten and drank.</p>

<p>In a few minutes, I rejoined the supper eaters, and set
myself to gratify the public curiosity.</p>

<p>It was necessary for me to recount everything, omitting
no details, from the moment when M. Drouet appeared to
the King as a vision, on the top of the Hill <span lang="fr">des Réligieuses</span>,
to the moment when the carriage started from the house of
the grocer, Sauce, and, lastly, to their arrival at the gate of
the Tuileries.</p>

<p>It can be easily understood with what avidity my tale
was devoured, especially by the women. At that period,
the women took a great interest in the Revolution: Madame
Duplay, Mdlle. Cornelie, and Mdlle. Estelle made me
repeat the same details over and over again; and, though
they had a sigh for Madame Elizabeth, the Queen was ever
an Austrian—that is to say, an enemy.</p>

<p>It was now eleven o’clock. Duplay, bursting with the
news which I brought him, resolved to go to the Jacobin
Club. There was no doubt but that, in consequence of the
great events taking place, the club would, despite the late
hour, be holding a sitting.</p>

<p>He asked me if I would like to accompany him; but,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_214"></a>[214]</span>
indefatigable though I was, I asked his permission to retire
to repose.</p>

<p>They gave me Dumont’s chamber, which was vacant, on
account of its owner having left the shop some eight days
previously. The ladies undertook to arrange the bed draperies,
and perform all the little offices which come so gratefully
from a woman’s tender hand and kind heart. Félicién
commenced by scowling at me; but when he perceived that
upon Estelle, by tacit consent, fell the greater share of the
labor on my account, his brow gradually relaxed.</p>

<p>Duplay set out for his club. They then informed me
that my chamber was ready. It was the first time for four
nights that I had slept in a bed, so you may imagine that
I stood upon no ceremony. I made a hurried bow to all,
rushed up to my room; and, on arriving there, blessed
Madame Duplay for the quantity of water and towels that
she had left me—as it required plenty of both to rid me of
that accursed dust of Champagne, with which I seemed to
be perfectly coated.</p>

<p>I jumped into bed, and, in a second, fell into the most
profound sleep.</p>

<p>On the next morning, I was awakened by M. Duplay,
after a most persistent shaking, which, in my sleep, I
attributed to other causes.</p>

<p>“Ah!” said he; “when you sleep you do sleep, and no
mistake, you drowsy provincials.”</p>

<p>“Bah!” said I. “It is you, then, who have been trying
to awaken, me?”</p>

<p>“Yes; and who tried last night, but could not succeed.”</p>

<p>“What did you wish of me?”</p>

<p>“Citizen Réné Besson, I fancied that you would excuse
the breach of hospitality, when you knew that I had something
most important to tell you.”</p>

<p>“Well, I am all attention, M. Duplay.”</p>

<p>“Call me Citizen,” said Duplay, pluming himself.</p>

<p>“Well, I listen to you, citizen.”</p>

<p>“As you know, I went to the club last night.”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“There I met M. Chanderlos de Laclos.”</p>

<p>“Citizen Laclos, you mean, I suppose?”</p>

<p>“I stand corrected. All men are now equal. Well, I
met Citizen Laclos, and told him all that you had related<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_215"></a>[215]</span>
to me concerning the journey of the King to Paris. Do
you know what he asked me? He asked me to take you
to the Palais Royal, in order that you may give your version
of the affair to the Duc d’Orleans.”</p>

<p>“I?”</p>

<p>“Yes, thou! In the meantime, you had better dress
yourself.”</p>

<p>“Do I go this morning, then?”</p>

<p>“Between nine and ten o’clock.”</p>

<p>“What time is it now?”</p>

<p>“Half-past eight.”</p>

<p>“You know, I suppose, that my only costume is that
of a National Guard?”</p>

<p>“It is the costume of patriots.”</p>

<p>“But still, when one goes near princes! Does my coat
want brushing?”</p>

<p>“Leave that to Catherine. You occupy yourself with
putting on a clean shirt, if you have any. I will see that
your clothes and boots are brushed. If you have not any
clean linen, I can lend you some.”</p>

<p>“Thank you; I have all that I require in my bag.”</p>

<p>“Dress, then; don’t waste time.”</p>

<p>And Maître Duplay, Republican though he was, enchanted
to conduct me before a prince, took my coat, hat, trousers
and boots, down stairs for Catherine to brush.</p>

<p>At nine o’clock exactly, I was ready.</p>

<p>We went along the Rue St. Honoré to the Rue de
Valois, and, arm-in-arm, entered the Palais Royal by the
gate which opens into that street.</p>

<p>Maître Duplay gave his name. <em>Citizen</em> Laclos had, no
doubt, given previous orders, for we were immediately
admitted.</p>

<p>Arrived at the first floor, no sooner had Duplay given
his name, than they sent at once for M. Chanderlos de
Laclos.</p>

<p>M. Chanderlos de Laclos rushed up.</p>

<p>“Is this the young fellow?” asked he.</p>

<p>“Himself,” replied M. Duplay.</p>

<p>“Let him come into the presence of his Highness.”</p>

<p>He conducted me along a straight corridor into a boudoir,
which led into a bed-room, the open door of which
allowed me to see that the bed was unmade. The open<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_216"></a>[216]</span>
windows, with the closed jalousies, gave access to a most
refreshing breeze.</p>

<p>His Royal Highness, clothed in a dressing-gown, made
of cashmere, with a cap to match, was sipping tea—a new
fashion imported from England; every one knows that his
Highness was thoroughly English—with a charming dame
of twenty-nine or thirty years of age, clothed in an elegant
morning dress, and who was, as I afterward learnt, Madame
Buffon.</p>

<p>M. le Duc d’Orleans, afterwards so celebrated under the
name of Philip Egalité, was a man of from forty-four to
forty-five years of age; a fat, full figure, red complexion,
with a good carriage, but the head a little too large—who,
on account of a quarrel with the Queen, had been cruelly
and unjustly treated by the court of inquiry into the naval
engagement at Ouessant, where he had comported himself
most bravely.</p>

<p>The result of this, on his side, was a most bitter hatred
of the Queen.</p>

<p>He received me with a nod of the head; Madame de
Buffon regarded me with curiosity. I was far from being
elegant, but I possessed great propriety of manner. Without
being handsome, I was at an age when youth supplies
the want of beauty. I was tall, well-made, with an open
expression of countenance, and a well-knit frame. The
loyalty of my heart beamed upon my face. In short, I
made the same impression upon the Duc d’Orleans and
Madame de Buffon as I had upon the King, the Queen,
and Madame Elizabeth—that of being a well-looking lad.</p>

<p>“You come from Varennes, my friend?” said the
Duke.</p>

<p>“Yes, monseigneur,” replied I.</p>

<p>“And you saw all that passed at the grocer’s—what do
you call him?”</p>

<p>“Sauce, monseigneur.”</p>

<p>“So it is. And you also saw what took place on the
road?”</p>

<p>“Monseigneur, I have not lost sight of the royal family
since their arrest.”</p>

<p>“Aha! There is a lady, a thorough Royalist. She
wishes to know all that has happened to her good King
and dear Queen. Will you be kind enough to give her a
history of it?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_217"></a>[217]</span></p>

<p>I commenced the account. When I mentioned Drouet,
the Duke interrupted me to ask particulars about him.
When I mentioned M. Dampierre, he made another interruption.
He made another when I mentioned Barnave,
Pétion, and Latour-Maubourg; in fact, he wished to know
even the minutest particulars.</p>

<p>Before I had finished, “Go and find Chartres,” he said to
M. de Laclos.</p>

<p>M. de Laclos went out; I continued my recital.</p>

<p>It was nearly brought to an end, when the door opened,
and gave entrance to a handsome young man, whom I had
already seen at the Jacobin Club on the occasion of my first
visit to Paris.</p>

<p>The young Prince bowed respectfully to his father, gallantly
kissed Madame Buffon’s hand, threw a scrutinizing
glance on me, and seemed to bend his whole attention on
what was passing.</p>

<p>“I regret not having summoned you before, Chartres,”
said the Duke. “Here is a young man who came to tell
us an extremely interesting history of the journey from Varennes.
He knew M. Drouet well—knew also the unhappy
Comte de Dampierre. He has seen the commissioners sent
by the National Assembly. He has seen all, in fact; and
all he has seen, he has retained; and I am sure you would
have felt great pleasure in listening to his recital.”</p>

<p>“But,” said the Duc de Chartres, “perhaps this young
gentleman will have the kindness——” Then, stopping,
and looking at his father, “Better still,” continued he;
“just as M. Laclos told me that you wished to see me, I
was going to breakfast.”</p>

<p>The Duc d’Orleans appeared to understand, and nodded
his head imperceptibly. M. le Duc de Chartres did the
same, pointing to me.</p>

<p>“Will you do me the favor to breakfast with me?—and,
during the meal, you can relate the whole affair.”</p>

<p>I addressed myself to M. Laclos.</p>

<p>“’Tis for me,” said I to him, “to thank his Highness for
the great honor which he has conferred upon me; but it is
for you to explain to him that I have left in the entrance-hall
some one who awaits me; but that will not prevent me
from giving Monseigneur,” continued I, turning to Duc
d’Orleans, “the recital which I have just given you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_218"></a>[218]</span></p>

<p>“But,” said the Duc de Chartres, smiling, “it will prevent
you from accepting my breakfast.”</p>

<p>“Monseigneur,” said I, “I am apprenticed to M. Duplay,
your carpenter. It was he who had the goodness to tell
M. Laclos that I should have the honor of being received this
morning by the Prince, your father. It would be but a bad
return, I think, for his kindness were I to leave him waiting
in the ante-chamber—he who is my master,—whilst I
had the honor of breakfasting with you. Excuse me,” said
I, laughing. “I am a savage from the forest of Argonne;
but, in all cases, I know Monseigneur to be sufficiently just
and good to make him my judge in this case, and I promise
faithfully to comply with his decree.”</p>

<p>“But, sir,” said Madame de Buffon, “do you know that,
for a savage——From what forest said you?”</p>

<p>“The Forest of Argonne.”</p>

<p>“You express yourself well. One would think that all
your life you had been talking to princes.”</p>

<p>“I have not all my life spoken to princes, but princes
have often done me the honor to speak to me.”</p>

<p>“Truly! Who were they?”</p>

<p>“M. le Prince de Condé and M. le Duc d’Enghien.
They used to hunt in the Forest of Argonne, and M.
d’Enghien was in the habit of taking me with him.”</p>

<p>“Well, nothing can astonish me, after this!” cried
Madame de Buffon.</p>

<p>“Did you see my cousin just before his departure?”
asked the Duc de Chartres.</p>

<p>“I am probably the last Frenchman to whom he paid the
honor of shaking his hand.”</p>

<p>“Well, then, you must accept my offer, and breakfast
with me.”</p>

<p>“That is my affair,” said the Duc. “Dear lady,
methinks I heard you say that you have some carpentry
work to be done in your apartments. I, for my part, have
several orders to give Duplay. Let him be brought up,
M. Laclos: we will give him our commands ourselves. Let
him pass through the <i lang="fr">salle-à-manger</i>, and there he can
drink a health to the nation, in a glass of wine, with these
young gentlemen.”</p>

<p>Thus was the affair arranged.</p>

<p>I told the Duc de Chartres, while breakfasting with him,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_219"></a>[219]</span>
all that related to our hunting expeditions in the Forest of
Argonne, to my education, the death of Pére Descharmes,
my sojourn at Varennes, the arrest of the King, and the return
to Paris.</p>

<p>“You are only half-armed, my dear M. Réné,” said the
Duc de Chartres, when leaving me. “My cousin of Enghien
gave you a gun: allow me to present you with a pair of pistols.”</p>

<p>He then took down a pair from a trophy—they were of
Versailles manufacture—and insisted on my accepting them,
as they matched my gun in pattern.</p>

<p>When I say insisted, perhaps I exaggerated a little, as
nothing could give me greater pleasure than to accept his
present.</p>

<p>As for Duplay, he received an order of the value of 5,000
francs, and drank with the Duc de Chartres to the health of
the nation, so that he returned home in the best of spirits,
rejoiced to have combined, in his morning’s visit, pleasure
and profit.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXXIX">CHAPTER XXXIX.<br>
<span class="fs70">TOUCHING THE PRINCESS LAMBALLE.</span></h2>


<p>It will easily be imagined that the event of which I am
treating was the subject of conversation for fifteen days in
the house of Duplay in which I was apprentice, in the place
of Dumont.</p>

<p>Félicién, seeing that I entertained for Mdlle. Cornelie and
Mdlle. Estelle only such affection as every well-educated
man ought to have for women, drew in his nails and teeth,
and became as good a comrade towards me as it was possible
for him to be.</p>

<p>Still the revolution marched on with gigantic strides; the
flight to Varennes having given it a terrible impetus.</p>

<p>On the 27th and 28th June, the Assembly promulgated
the following decrees:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_220"></a>[220]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The <span lang="fr">gard du corps</span> is disbanded.</p>

<p>“The King will be given a guard, under the command of
the commander of the Parisian National Guard, to contribute
to his safety and well being.</p>

<p>“The Queen will have a private guard of her own.</p>

<p>“Upon the events of the 21st of June, the Assembly
will nominate three commissioners, selected from their whole
body, to receive the declaration of the King and Queen.</p>

<p>“The sanction, the acceptance of the King, and all his
legislative and executive functions, are suspended.</p>

<p>“The ministers are authorized, each in his own department,
and on his own responsibility, to assume the executive
power.”</p>
</div>

<p>The three commissioners were MM. Touche, Dandré, and
Dupont.</p>

<p>There was, therefore, as can be readily seen, positive
suspension of the functions of royalty.</p>

<p>This private guard of the Queen’s was a torment to her
every day—every hour—every minute.</p>

<p>We have seen Prudhomme astonished that the Queen,
having worn-out shoes, should require new ones, and that
she should consider it indecent to leave open the doors of
her bath and her bed-room.</p>

<p>In fact, the National Guard, frightened of the responsibility
placed on their shoulders, literally kept the Queen in
eyesight, and compelled her to keep open the doors of her
bathing and bed-room. Once, the Queen, inspired with a
natural feeling of modesty, having drawn the curtains of
her bed the man on guard drew them back, for fear that
she should escape by the staircase. On another occasion,
the King having come to visit her about one in the morning,
and having shut the door of the apartment—not of the
Queen, but of his wife—the sentinel thrice opened it, saying,
“Shut it as often as you like; I shall open it every
time that you shut it!”</p>

<p>Happily, in this misery, the Queen found a friend.
This friend was the Princess de Lamballe whose history is
so well known that it is needless for me to touch upon it.</p>

<p>She was, however, through all vicissitudes, a faithful and
affectionate friend to the Queen.</p>

<p>About the commencement of 1791, after the death of
Mirabeau, the political horizon became so black that the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_221"></a>[221]</span>
King and Queen, the Count de Fersen, and Madame
Elizabeth, all counselled the Princess to fly to Sardinia.
Even the Pope, Pius the Sixth himself, insisted that she
should visit Rome, to rejoin the friends of the King, who
having raised in the Assembly the famous storm concerning
the right of emigration sustained by Mirabeau, had happily
crossed the frontier; but she firmly rejected all such
proposals.</p>

<p>The Duc de Penthièvre who loved her as if she were his
daughter, and the Duchess of Orleans, who admired her
courage, wished by some means to force her to leave
France. The Duc persuaded Louis the Sixteenth to write
to the Court at Turin, in order that the King of Sardinia,
as head of the family, should interpose his influence to
compel the Princess to return to his dominions.</p>

<p>Here is the reply of the Princess de Lamballe:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<span class="smcap">Sire and Respected Cousin</span>,—</p>

<p>“I do not remember that any of our illustrious ancestors
of the House of Savoy, before or after the great
Charles Emmanuel, of illustrious memory, ever disgraced
themselves by an act of treachery. I should do so were I
to quit the Court of France at this critical juncture. You
will excuse my refusing your truly royal invitation. The
shedding of blood, and the madness of the States, alike
command that one and all should unite their efforts for the
preservation of the King and Queen and the royal family
of France. It is impossible to shake my resolution. I
have determined, once and for all, never to abandon, at a
moment when they are forsaken by their oldest servants,
those who have none to look to but me.</p>

<p>“In happier days, your Majesty can count on my obedience;
but to-day, as the Court of France is open to the
persecutions of its most atrocious enemies, I beg humbly
the right of following my own instincts of right. At the
most brilliant epoch of the reign of Marie Antoinette, I
felt the warmth of royal favor, and can I now abandon
her? To do so, sire, would be to set the seal of eternal
infamy not only on my brow, but on those of all my relations;
and I fear that more than all other torments.”</p>
</div>

<p>It was then that the Queen employed a <i lang="fr">ruse</i> to get her
to quit France.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_222"></a>[222]</span></p>

<p>She had been sent once before on a mission from the
Queen to England; and the inherent grace of the family
of Savoy—the same which made the Duchess of Burgundy
so powerful over Louis XIV—enabled her to obtain from
the King and Queen of England a promise never to forsake
the King and Queen of France.</p>

<p>The moment to recall that promise to the English Court
had arrived. The Queen desired the Princess de Lamballe
to set out for London, and continue the negotiations
already so happily commenced. She therefore left Paris,
and reached England, stopping at Calais, at the famous
“Hotel Dessein,” immortalized by Sterne in his “Sentimental
Journey.”</p>

<p>It was whilst in London that the Princess learnt the
flight to Varennes, the return of the royal family, and their
imprisonment in the Tuileries. She sent a young English
girl, in whom she had the utmost confidence, to Paris.</p>

<p>This messenger appeared close to the Queen. She had
come in the name of the Princess, to learn the exact situation
in which the family were placed.</p>

<p>The Queen sent her a letter, and a ring, enclosing a lock
of her hair, as white as if her years numbered eighty.</p>

<p>On the ring was inscribed, “Whitened by sorrow.”</p>

<p>I give, underneath, an exact copy of the letter:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<span class="smcap">My Very Dear Friend</span>,—</p>

<p>“The King is about to accept the Constitution. In a
short time, he will be solemnly proclaimed. A few days
since, I held a secret consultation in your apartment, with
some of our most trusty friends, among whom were Alexandre
Lameth, Duport, Barnave, Montmarni, Bertrand de
Malville. These two last combated against the counsel of
those of the Ministry, and others, who advised the King to
accept the Constitution immediately, and without restrictions;
but they formed too feeble a minority for me to
decide, as they wished to pray the King to pay heed to
their opinion. All the others seemed to think that the contrary
measure would re-establish tranquillity, weaken the
party of the Jacobins, our enemies, and enlarge greatly the
number of our partizans in the nation. Your absence compelled
me to call Elizabeth to our aid, to clear the Pavilion
of Flora of spies. She did not acquit herself very well.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_223"></a>[223]</span>
Poor Elizabeth! you cannot expect much cunning or circumspection
in a woman so little accustomed to the
intrigues of a Court, and to the dangers which surrounded
us. They try to persuade us that we are in no danger.
Would that it were so, and that I could again open my
arms and heart freely, to receive my best friend! Although
these are the most ardent aspirations of my heart, nevertheless,
my dear, my very dear Lamballe, pay heed to nothing
but your own inspirations. Some people say that they
see the future brilliant as the sun at mid-day. For my
part, I confess, it seems covered with clouds. I cannot see
future events with all the security that I could wish. The
King, Elizabeth, myself,—in fact, all the family—wish
much to see you; but we should be horrified at the thought
of dragging you into the midst of events equally fearful as
those you have already witnessed.</p>

<p>“Reflect, then, and act as you think best. If we cannot
see you, send us the result of your conferences with the
Precipice.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> Your young English friend will bring you
plenty of letters. Will you have them sent to their respective
addresses as quickly as possible, either by her, or in
any other way that you may consider more fitting?</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="padr2">“Your affectionate</span><br>
“<span class="smcap">Marie Antoinette</span>.”</p>
</div>

<p>On receiving this letter, the Princess left London, where
she was in safety, and, without the slightest hesitation, returned
to the Tuileries, to take her place by the side of the
Queen.</p>

<p>But whilst Madame de Lamballe was at London, great
events were taking place in Paris. The letter which we
have quoted, although undated, is virtually dated, through
the fact that the Queen speaks of the King’s accepting the
Constitution; and it was on the 3rd of September only that
a deputation from the National Assembly presented the Act
of the Constitution for the acceptance of the King.</p>

<p>Let us now retrace our steps a little, and throw a glance
at that terrible day, the 17th of July—day of the Champs
de Mars—day of the red flag, which in 1848, furnished
to M. de Lamartine, one of his most wonderful oratorical
efforts.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XL">CHAPTER XL.<br>
<span class="fs70">THE TIDE RISES.</span></h2>


<p>The Queen was right in not viewing events in the same
light as those who surrounded her.</p>

<p>Firstly, the struggle was between the Assembly and the
Court. The Assembly won the day.</p>

<p>Then it was between the Constitutionals and the Aristocrats.
The Constitutionals won the day. Now it was to be
between the Constitutionals and the Republicans.</p>

<p>It is true that the Republicans had only just begun to
appear, but in their first birth they formed this terrible
principle—<em>No more monarchy!</em></p>

<p>You will remember that the commissioners had been
appointed by the Assembly to examine Louis XVI.</p>

<p>These three declared, in the name of their seven committees,
that they had found no reason to put Louis XVI
on his trial.</p>

<p>The Assembly took the opinion of the commissioners,
but the Jacobin Club refused its sanction to the Assembly.
The Assembly had then above it a high chamber, which
could annihilate its decisions with its veto.</p>

<p>In order to understand the situation and the events about
to take place, it is necessary to say that at this juncture
there were opposed to each other, three distinct parties.</p>

<p>The Royalists who wished the King absolute—that is to
say, without the Constitution; the Constitutionals, who
wished the King with a Constitution; and the Republicans,
who wished neither King nor Constitution, but a
republic.</p>

<p>The Assembly, as we have said, voted that there was no
necessity to put the King on trial.</p>

<p>But, through concession to the public feeling, it had
voted two measures—one preventive, the other repressive.</p>

<p>This was the repressive measure.</p>

<p>“That Bouillé, and all servants, officers, couriers, and
accomplices in the flight, should be prosecuted.”</p>

<p>This was the preventive measure:—</p>

<p>“That if a king breaks his oath, or attacks, or does not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_225"></a>[225]</span>
defend, his people, he shall be cast from his throne, become
a simple citizen, and be tried for the offences committed
previous to his degradation.”</p>

<p>The repressive measure was one of those timid ones
proper to a decayed Assembly, which feels that its power is
crumbling away.</p>

<p>During some days, or, rather, nights, the Jacobin sitting
became stormy.</p>

<p>During the sitting, in which the true culprit—that is to
say, the King—was left alone, in order to arrest and punish
the minor offenders—that is to say, Bouillé, Fersen, the
<span lang="fr">gardes du corps</span>, and Madame de Tourzel,—M. Robespierre
asked in vain to have the report distributed, and the discussion
adjourned.</p>

<p>As it was known in advance that the discussion would be
stormy, Robespierre went to the club. He had been accused,
at the Assembly, of republicanism, and—mark this
well,—on the 13th of July 1791, Robespierre did not disdain
to again avow himself a Republican.</p>

<p>On that evening, we all went to the Jacobins; M. Duplay
and myself in the superior hall, and the three women
and Félicién in the inferior, where a society was held, called
the Society of the Two Sexes.</p>

<p>During my absence from Paris, Robespierre had acquired
a great popularity, to which he had succeeded by degrees.
He had still the same voice, though, perhaps, he spoke a
little stronger than the last time that I had heard him; and
I fancied that I noted a marked progress in his intonation,
but still the same spinning-out of his facts.</p>

<p>He had just finished his discourse, when a great disturbance
was heard. It was the Cordeliers’ Club, which, in the
persons of Danton and Legendre, had made an irruption
among the Jacobins.</p>

<p>They were neither vague nor lengthy in their demands.</p>

<p>Danton, in an outburst of ironic thunder, demanded how
the Society dared to take upon itself to pronounce reformed
opinions before the nation had done so? Legendre directly
attacked the King—called to reason the societies who,
working in an underground manner, undermined the decisions
of the Assembly, and terminated in saying, “What
I say is for the good of the Assembly itself.”</p>

<p>There was almost a menace expressed in these last words.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_226"></a>[226]</span>
Keeping calm and cold during Robespierre’s speech, M. de
Laclos, the intendant of the Duc d’Orleans, applauded vehemently
Danton and Legendre.</p>

<p>The Constitutionals of the Assembly got up, and went
out.</p>

<p>Danton and Laclos conferred together an instant in a
whisper; then a voice was heard, crying, “Open the doors
for the public deputies!”</p>

<p>The doors opened, and there entered the fraternal Society
of the Halles, and the Society of the Two Sexes, which
held its meetings in the Lower Hall. They carried addresses
against the Assembly, or, rather, against the monarchy.</p>

<p>Preoccupied with Danton and Legendre, I lost a part of
the thread of what passed at the tribune. A young surgeon
read a letter, which had been written in the Palais Royal
in the presence of three hundred persons. A bishop threw
himself into his arms, and urged him to oppose the deputies.
Robespierre looked on with his sardonic smile; Danton,
Legendre, and Laclos with a hateful grin.</p>

<p>Robespierre saw not what was going on on the other side
of Paris, but probably Danton knew; and that was what
he was recounting in a whisper to Laclos, and what Laclos
was listening to with such attention.</p>

<p>On the other side of Paris was a club—a fraternal society,—in
the midst of which rested a young man, who was
secretary to the club, in oblivion. This young man one
day emerged from his obscurity, to raise around him a
gigantic storm, after which he again subsided into mediocrity.
The name of this young man was Callieu.</p>

<p>What was Callieu doing in this fraternal society? Almost
nothing. He prepared an address against the Assembly,
signed “<em>The People!</em>”</p>

<p>On the day before that evening—how I came to forget to
mention it, I cannot think,—the 12th of July, there was a
great disturbance in Paris. All hats were waving in a
burst of enthusiasm.</p>

<p>On Sunday, the 10th, the body of Voltaire ought to have
been removed to the Pantheon, but the weather was unpropitious;
and there was no fête in Paris, on account of the
rain. The removal of Voltaire’s corpse was therefore postponed
till the morrow.</p>

<p>The triumphal procession entered by the barrier of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_227"></a>[227]</span>
Charenton; and accompanied by an immense crowd, drawn
by horses presented by the Queen, the bier crossed Paris,
and stopped at the house where the author of the “Philosophic
Dictionary” had died.</p>

<p>There they sang choruses to his glory. The Calas family,
led by Madame de Vilette, laid down crowns on the sarcophagus,
before the temple of Flora, which was closed, on
the pretence of the absence of Madame de Lamballe.</p>

<p>On the 12th, Voltaire entered the Pantheon. On the
13th, in the morning, they played a sacred drama, with a
grand chorus and orchestra, in Notre Dame. It was entitled,
“<span lang="fr">Le Prise de la Bastille</span>.”</p>

<p>In the evening, Danton and Legendre came to the Jacobins,
and turned out the Constitutionals; whilst at the
club on the other side of Paris they were signing an address
against the Assembly.</p>

<p>On the 14th, the anniversary of the taking of the Bastille,
when a drama was performed on the subject, the
Bishop of Paris performed mass at the altar of the country
in the midst of the rain.</p>

<p>Each day now brought an event. On the evening of the
15th, the Assembly voted not only that the King should
be brought to judgment, but that his offices should be suspended
until he agreed to <em>swear to the Constitution</em>.</p>

<p>The Constitutionals carried it.</p>

<p>The Assembly knew so well that it had committed an
unpopular act, that it demanded to be protected by Lafayette
and 5,000 men, without counting the National Guard
and the pikes of the Faubourg St. Antoine.</p>

<p>The crowd which could not enter—and their name was
legion—took up a position on the other side of the citizen
guard, who made a ring round the Riding Hall.</p>

<p>The moment the vote became known to the crowd, they
yelled “Treason!” and re-entered Paris by its three great
arteries, the Boulevards, the Rue St. Honoré, and the street
which is now known by that name. They then began to
shut the theatres and the houses of play and pleasure, and
in consequence of the disturbance, the police themselves
closed two or three theatres.</p>

<p>Little work was done in these days of ebullition.
M. Duplay sent me to see what was going on at the Assembly;
I returned to announce to him the triumph of
the King.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_228"></a>[228]</span></p>

<p>“Good!” said he. “Let us get over supper quickly,
and then off to the Jacobins. There will be a disturbance
there this evening.”</p>

<p>M. Duplay was right.</p>

<p>Robespierre was in the tribune. He attacked, in the
midst of vociferous plaudits, the vote of the Assembly.
When he had finished, M. Laclos took his place. You must
not forget that Laclos was the intendant of the Duc d’Orleans.
He demanded that a bulletin should be issued, proclaiming
the forfeiture.</p>

<p>“There will be,” said he, “ten million signatures.”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes!” cried the spectators, with one voice. “Ten,
fifteen, twenty millions! The women and children, even,
shall be compelled to sign!”</p>

<p>A powerful voice shook the nation. It was Danton’s.
For some days the Cordeliers had fraternized with the
Jacobins, and Danton walked with Robespierre.</p>

<p>“Only,” said Danton, in a low voice, “let us have no
women. They are generally Royalists. They would vote
for the deposal of a King only in order to raise up another.”</p>

<p>Saying these words, he stared fixedly at the author of
“Liaisons Dangereuses.” Not a smile nor a frown ruffled
the habitually stern features of Laclos.</p>

<p>Perceiving the silence kept by the Duke of Orleans’ man,
he added, “And more, I prefer an address to the adopted
societies to a public one.”</p>

<p>Laclos said nothing, but appeared as if listening to something
outside the building.</p>

<p>All at once, a large mass of people entered the club.
They were what were called the Bucks of the Palais Royal,
dragging with them about fifty young women of questionable
character.</p>

<p>“Ah, ah!” murmured Danton. “’Tis a planned
affair!”</p>

<p>All the newly-arrived mixed with the Jacobins, crying,
“The forfeiture—the forfeiture!”</p>

<p>Laclos ascended the tribune.</p>

<p>“You see,” said he, “’tis the people—the people who
desire the forfeiture. A petition is necessary, of which I
approve.”</p>

<p>All this immense crowd, who probably had the word,
cried with one voice, “The petition—the petition!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_229"></a>[229]</span></p>

<p>Then, with uproarious enthusiasm, the petition was voted.
It was agreed that the next day, at eleven o’clock, the
Jacobins should meet and hear the reading of it, after
which it would be brought to the <span lang="fr">Champs de Mars</span>, where
it was to be signed by the populace, and thence forwarded
to the adopted societies.</p>

<p>During this tumult, M. Duplay had taken hold of my
arm, and drew me sharply on one side. He then pointed
me out a woman standing outside one of the tribunes, who
appeared to be taking the greatest possible interest in what
was passing.</p>

<p>“Look at that woman,” said he; “it is the Citizen Roland
Platrière—a good patriot.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XLI">CHAPTER XLI.<br>
<span class="fs70">CONCERNING THE BILL OF FORFEITURE.</span></h2>


<p>Madame Roland was very far from having assumed at
that period the important position that she afterwards held.
As yet she had never fretted and fumed her hour upon the
political stage. In fact, she was not yet a minister. I did
not pay more attention to her than one commonly pays to a
woman. She appeared to be about thirty years of age, of
fresh complexion—heat of the blood, if one may say so.
Her mouth was large, but filled with irreproachable teeth;
her hands were large and muscular, but well-shaped; her
nose was <i lang="fr">retroussé</i>; her figure was good—small waist and
well-filled hips, but, on the whole, having a decidedly voluptuous
tendency. Thus was Madame Roland, in the evening
of the 15th of July, 1791.</p>

<p>Just as I was observing her, I heard some one call
M. Duplay.</p>

<p>Duplay turned round. It was M. Laclos who called him.
He held a pen in his hand, and had a sheet of paper on his
table. M. Brissot was sitting beside him.</p>

<p>“My dear Duplay,” said he, “I was about to write the
petition for which all are going to vote, but my writing is
too much like that of the secretary of the Duc d’Orleans.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_230"></a>[230]</span>
There is nothing wrong in the matter, I assure you. Here
is M. Brissot, a member of the National Assembly, and he
would not be likely to work against his colleagues. We
must have some one whose handwriting is unknown. Your
young man can write, I suppose?”</p>

<p>“Rather, I should say,” replied M. Duplay; “he is a
scholar.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Laclos, mildly, “be kind enough to call
him hither, and tell him what we require. You will dictate,
Brissot, will you not?”</p>

<p>Feeling sure that the conversation concerned me, I approached.</p>

<p>They told me what was required. It would give me an
active participation in what was going on, so I was quite
willing.</p>

<p>M. Brissot dictated.</p>

<p>As it was not permitted to make a copy of the petition,
I can only give it from memory. It was well and
strongly worded; it had, metamorphically speaking, two
heads; the one reproached the Assembly with timidity,
and the other accused them of having not dared to
usurp the King’s so-called prerogative, and asserted, at the
same time, that the King’s supposed deprivation of his
regal rights by the Assembly was, in reality, a sham.</p>

<p>As I was writing these words, Brissot still dictating,
Laclos arousing himself, placed his hand on Brissot’s
arm, and said, “Citizen Brissot, I doubt whether the
friends of the Constitution, who compose the greater
number of our club, will sign, unless you make a slight
alteration in the words, but which will not alter the
meaning.”</p>

<p>“What alteration?” demanded Brissot.</p>

<p>“Were I in your place, I would insert, after ‘<em>his
original dignity</em>,’ these words, ‘<em>by constitutional means</em>.’”</p>

<p>Brissot reflected a moment, and then, with a shrug of
his shoulders he said, “I see no objection.”</p>

<p>Then he continued dictating to me.</p>

<p>“<em>By constitutional means.</em>”</p>

<p>I turned round to see whether Robespierre and Danton
would not make some objection to our employment; but
both had gone, and, in fact, the hall was all but empty, so
that the petition was dictated to space.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_231"></a>[231]</span></p>

<p>The two editors remarked that the members had retired
because they felt their presence to be useless, and knew that
the petition would be read to them on the following morning;
but soon an emissary arrived, who spoke in an undertone
to M. de Laclos. During this time I again read the
petition, and then I understood the ponderous significance
of the five words which had been so aptly added by the well-known
author of “Liaisons Dangereuses.”</p>

<p><em>The constitutional means</em> by which they could replace the
King, was by placing on the throne the Dauphin, governed
by a regency; but the brothers of the King, the Comte
d’Artois and the Comte de Provence, being out of France,
the Regent’s office belonged, of right, to the Duc d’Orleans,
who would thus take the same place by the throne of Louis
XVI as his ancestor had by the throne of his predecessor,
Louis XV. I asked myself why it was that Brissot never
thought of that, though I did. But I said to myself that
perhaps he would not be angry at being hidden behind the
word <em>constitutional</em> as he knew that the petition was his
own work.</p>

<p>At this moment, the fears of M. de Laclos appeared to
be realized. The emissary who had whispered in his ear,
had come to tell him that the constitutional Royalists of
the Jacobins, and those of the National Assembly, were going
to rejoin the Feuillants, and thus separate themselves
from the pure Jacobin—that is to say, the Republican.</p>

<p>The two heads of the emigration movement were Duport
and Lameth.</p>

<p>Their intention was to form a new club, composed of
friends of the Constitution—an aristocratic assembly where
none were admitted but by a pass-card, and where they received
none but electors, who then stayed with the veritable
Jacobins—none, with the exception of six or seven demagogue
deputies and the <i lang="fr">canaille</i> who followed in the steps of
the Duc d’Orleans, and who formed the entire club.</p>

<p>“What is to be done?” asked Brissot. “They wish to
have the Assembly to themselves.”</p>

<p>“Good!” said Laclos: “but what does it matter as long
as we have the people on our side? Let us proceed.”</p>

<p>Brissot continued his dictation, in which, however, Laclos
no longer took part.</p>

<p>On the morrow, Saturday, M. Duplay and myself did not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_232"></a>[232]</span>
fail to be at the Jacobin club, where were assembled scarcely
thirty persons.</p>

<p>They waited an hour; and at twelve there were assembled,
perhaps, forty. The petition was read and applauded.
All paid attention to the phrase introduced by M. Laclos,
and it was decided that the petition should be taken in its
present form to the <span lang="fr">Champ de Mars</span>, there to be signed on
the altar of the country.</p>

<p>A deputation was organized to carry the petition. M.
Duplay had work to do at the Palais Royal. He advised
me to follow the delegates, and then return to report to him
what had passed.</p>

<p>We arrived at the <span lang="fr">Champ de Mars</span>. As the report had
spread about that the petition would be taken there, thousands
of people had assembled.</p>

<p>The altar of the country was surmounted with an immense
picture, representing the apotheosis of Voltaire.</p>

<p>The delegates mounted almost to the top of the altar, and
commenced the reading; but they saw a group approaching,
whom they recognised as members of the Cordeliers. They
were received with acclamation, and, on their behalf, the
reading was again commenced.</p>

<p>All went well till the phrase introduced by M. Laclos,
“<em>By all constitutional means</em>.”</p>

<p>“Pardon,” said a voice; “would you mind reading that
passage again?”</p>

<p>The reader continued, “<em>By all constitutional means</em>.”</p>

<p>“Stop!” cried the same voice.</p>

<p>A man then approached.</p>

<p>“Citizen,” said he, “my name is Bonneville. I am
editor of <cite>The Mouth of Iron</cite>. The people are deceived.”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes, yes!” cried the Cordeliers.</p>

<p>“How deceive the people?” said the delegate charged
with the reading of the petition.</p>

<p>“I say, for the second time, that the people are deceived!”
cried Bonneville. “‘<em>By all constitutional means</em>,’
signifies ‘<em>by a regency</em>.’ And what is a regency? The
royalty of D’Orleans in the place of the royalty of Louis
XVI.”</p>

<p>“In the place of the royalty of Capet!” cried a voice
that I recognised as having heard before.</p>

<p>“How Capet?” said a Jacobin.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_233"></a>[233]</span></p>

<p>“Without doubt,” replied the same mocking voice.
“Since the nobles no longer have titles—since M. Mirabeau
called himself only Riquetti—since M. de Lafayette called
himself only M. Moltier—the King Louis XVI can call
himself only Capet.”</p>

<p>“Take care,” said a Jacobin; “France is not yet ripe
for a republic.”</p>

<p>“If she is not ripe for a republic,” cried Camille Desmoulins—for
that was the man to whom the voice I recognised
belonged—“how is it that she is rotten for monarchy?”</p>

<p>“To the vote—to the vote!” all cried.</p>

<p>They voted, and, with almost perfect unanimity, declared
that the obnoxious phrase should be cut out. Then, in the
enthusiasm which followed this vote, they all swore neither
to recognise Louis XVI nor any other King.</p>

<p>On the morrow, Sunday, it was arranged that the people,
forewarned by notice posted on the walls, should go to sign
the petition on the altar.</p>

<p>“Still, citizen, we lack one thing.”</p>

<p>“What is that?” asked Camille Desmoulins.</p>

<p>“It is to have the law on our side.”</p>

<p>“We have it; since the Assembly have suspended the
King, we have deposed him.”</p>

<p>“We must get from the <span lang="fr">Hotel de Ville</span> an authorization
to hold the meeting to-morrow.”</p>

<p>All started for the <span lang="fr">Hotel de Ville</span>. They had but to keep
on the quays; but the distance was rather a lengthy one;
but as the refusal of the Mayor might spoil all, and as I
wished to give a report to M. Duplay, I went with the
others to the <span lang="fr">Hotel de Ville</span>.</p>

<p>M. Bailly was not there; he was at the Place Vendome,
watching the proceedings of the Assembly; but they found
his substitute, told him of the matter, found him not unwilling,
and demanded a written authorization. He said he
did not see the necessity—a verbal permission being quite
sufficient; that the people were always legal, exercising
only their right of petition.</p>

<p>I returned to M. Duplay’s, telling him that the petition
would be signed to-morrow, and that the signature would
be approved of by Bailly, or, at least, by his substitute.</p>

<p>We were ignorant of what was going on in the Assembly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_234"></a>[234]</span></p>

<p>The Assembly had learnt the decision taken by the Cordeliers
and the Jacobins. It would not do to allow the people
to take this supremacy upon itself. They appealed to
Bailly and the municipal council.</p>

<p>At ten o’clock, Bailly and his council decided that on the
morrow, Sunday, 17th July, the decree of the Assembly,
hearing “that the suppression of executive power should
last until the Constitutional Act had been presented to, and
accepted by, the King,” should be fixed at eight o’clock
punctually, and that proclamation of the decree should be
with sound of trumpet proclaimed by the huissiers of the
city.</p>

<p>Therefore, whoever did not recognise an act proceeding
from the National Assembly—that is to say, the people’s
representatives—should be rebels to the law, and should be
treated as such.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XLII">CHAPTER XLII.<br>
<span class="fs70 lsp0">WHAT TOOK PLACE BETWEEN THE HAIRDRESSER AND
THE INVALID.</span></h2>


<p>We had for neighbor, in the Rue St. Honoré, two doors
lower down than our own, a hair-dresser, named Léger.
This hair-dresser, like all his <i lang="fr">confrères</i>, was a staunch Royalist.
No doubt the reader would ask the reason why hair-dressers
were all Royalists.</p>

<p>That is easily explained.</p>

<p>The hair-dressers’ was one of the corporations that had
suffered the most in the Revolution. Those under Louis
XV, and even under Louis XVI—who had invented such
fantastic head-dresses, worn by the ladies of the nobility for
more than half a century—were a body of men not to be
despised.</p>

<p>Hair-dressers of this period had a select circle of their own,
and many privileges, which they would not surrender, even
on the night of the 4th of August.</p>

<p>Not only could they mix in the society of the larger circles,
but had the <i lang="fr">entrées</i> to the more select boudoirs of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_235"></a>[235]</span>
noblesse, and also carried the sword, as was customary with
gentlemen.</p>

<p>It is true that this sword, at most times, was of no more
use than a harlequin’s wand, being but a mere toy. Of
some, the blades were simply wood, others having no blade
at all, the handle being attached to the scabbard.</p>

<p>But for some time past things went from bad to worse
with this celebrated corporation of hair-dressers. Their society
was gradually sinking into oblivion, to them worse
than death, and Talma had just struck the last blow even to
the head-dressing of men, by his creation of the character
of <em>Litus</em>, which had caused his name to be given to the
fashion of wearing the hair cut short.</p>

<p>The most desperate enemies of the new government—that
is to say, the revolutionary government—was, therefore,
the hair-dressers.</p>

<p>That was not all. By frequenting the mansions of the
aristocracy—by holding so often between their hands, for
more than an hour at a time, the heads of the handsomest
ladies of the Court—by chatting with the several coxcombs
whose hair they were in the habit of dressing—by serving
their noble clients in the character of messengers of love—by
becoming the <i lang="fr">confidantes</i> of the passions of their employers—the
hair-dressers had become libertines, for the advantage
of their pockets.</p>

<p>Now, on Saturday evening, as I have already stated, at
the very moment when the municipality issued the decree
against the petitioners, our neighbor Léger came and asked
M. Duplay to lend him a centre-bit.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the difference of opinion which separated
these two neighbors, the centre-bit was at once lent,
without a single question.</p>

<p>An Invalid awaited him at the door, to whom he handed
it, at the same time exchanging with him some few words,
and each one went his own way.</p>

<p>The following was their projected scheme for the next
day:—</p>

<p>At this period, when the women commenced to take such
an active part in the revolution, many beautiful patriots
intended accompanying their brothers, husbands, and lovers
to sign the petition on the altar of the country. Thanks to
the centre-bit lent by Maître Duplay, our libertine hair-dresser<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_236"></a>[236]</span>
would be enabled to bore a hole in the platform of
the altar, under the shelter of which, if he could not see
the lovely features of the charming patriotic women, he
could, at least, perceive the interesting proceedings of the
people.</p>

<p>Not wishing to enjoy this pleasure alone, the Citizen
Léger invited an old Invalid to share it with him. The
Invalid accepted the invitation; but like a cautious man,
knowing that they could not feed themselves with their
eyes, proposed that, in addition to the centre-bit, they
should take with them eatables and a barrel of water. This
last step was agreed to by Léger. Accordingly, on the
morning of Sunday, the 19th, half an hour before the light
set in, our two gallants might be seen scaling the altar of
the country, with their centre-bit and their provisions.
Upon gaining the platform, they gently lifted one of the
planks, introduced themselves beneath, replaced the plank,
and then commenced their work.</p>

<p>Unfortunately for our two curious friends, the fête
attracted none but themselves. From daybreak, the
<span lang="fr">Champ de Mars</span> commenced to get animated. The “<span lang="fr">merchands</span>”
of cakes and lemonade, hoping that the patriotism
would hunger and thirst those who signed the document,
commenced arriving from all quarters. Tired of
walking about, one of these women ascended the altar, for
the purpose of looking at the picture of the triumph of
Voltaire. While reading the oath of Brutus, of which she
understood nothing, she felt an instrument piercing the
sole of her shoe. She immediately cried out for help, and
declared there were malefactors underneath the altar; upon
which a young man went in search of the guard of Gros
Caillon. The guard, fancying the affair was not worth
while troubling himself about, refused to stir.</p>

<p>In the absence of the soldiers, he called the passing
workmen. These, more sensible to the cries of distress
than the guard, came with their tools. They set to work,
without delay, to open the altar, and there they found
Léger and his companion, in a pretended sleep! They
were not long, however, bringing them to consciousness,
when they were commanded to explain the cause of their
presence there, and to state if their intentions were justifiable,
and they were forced to own the truth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_237"></a>[237]</span></p>

<p>At that moment, a curious individual dropped himself
under the altar, to see what it was like, and there found
the barrel of water. Mistaking this for powder, he rushed
forth, crying, with all his might, that the two prisoners had
intended blowing up the altar, as well as those who would
find themselves thereon. The hair-dresser and Invalid cried
loudly that it was water, and not powder, and that, by
breaking the barrel, they would arrive at the truth; but
the truth was too simple. They thought it more natural
to strangle the two unfortunate men, or decapitate them,
and promenade their heads on the top of a pike.</p>

<p>At this stage of the proceedings, the bailiffs of the municipality
arrived, and proclaimed the arrest of the Mayor.
They then proceeded towards the Roule, but were overtaken
at the top of Rue St. Honoré by the crowd carrying the
heads of the two supposed assassins on the top of their
pikes. I fancied that I could recognise one of these as that
of a neighbor; it turned out to be that of the poor hair-dresser,
who came the preceding night to borrow the
centre-bit from M. Duplay. I could scarcely believe my
eyes. What crime could they possibly be guilty of? I
called M. Duplay. There must have been a strange accent
in my voice; for, with the exception of my grandmother,
who was always occupied reading and re-reading her volume
of the “Arabian Nights,” the whole family rushed towards
me; the women shrieked with terror, but one was beginning
to get accustomed to these sorts of spectacles, and, by
degrees, they risked looking.</p>

<p>Every one recognised Léger.</p>

<p>What had he done?</p>

<p>We inquired. They were two great criminals, who had
intended blowing up the altar of the country, and those
who might be on it.</p>

<p>Others said they were two National Guards, who were
beheaded by the people for attempting to enforce the execution
of the law.</p>

<p>The noise spread in the Assembly. Duport, who, with
Charles Lameth, separated himself from the Republican
Jacobins, was then President. He was not backward in
accusing his late colleagues of the crime.</p>

<p>“Gentlemen,” said he, to the Assembly, “Two good
citizens have just perished on the <span lang="fr">Champ de Mars</span> for having<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_238"></a>[238]</span>
said to a deluded mass that they must not break the
laws of their country—they were hanged on the spot.”</p>

<p>“’Tis true!” cried Regnault de St. Jean d’Angely. “I
confirm that news; they were two National Guards. Gentlemen,
I demand martial law. It is the duty of this Assembly,
gentlemen, to pronounce all persons attempting to
exhort the people to resist, either by personal acts, or by collective
or individual writings, guilty of treachery to the
nation.”</p>

<p>This was just what the Assembly desired, composed, as
it was, principally of Royalists and Constitutionalists, and
in which the Republicans—that is to say, those who upheld
the petition, and, consequently, wished for the dethronement
of the King—were to be found in a very small number.</p>

<p>It was therefore decreed that the President of the Assembly,
and the Mayor of Paris, should inquire into the
real state of affairs, in order to take rigorous measures if
events passed as were reported.</p>

<p>They did not give themselves the trouble to inquire into
the truth, but took the measures. Robespierre then left the
Assembly without saying a word, rushed to the Club of the
Jacobins, to announce to them the news.</p>

<p>At the club he found nearly thirty persons; they all
tumultuously voted the withdrawal of the petition, and Lanterre
was despatched to the <span lang="fr">Champ de Mars</span> to take possession
of it.</p>

<p>Such was the state of affairs when M. Duplay returned
from the Jacobins, and asked where were his wife and
daughters.</p>

<p>He was told they were gone with Félicién to the Champ
de Mars to see the petition signed.</p>

<p>“Not an instant is to be lost!” cried M. Duplay. “If
the petition is not withdrawn in time, there will most certainly
be a row, perhaps fire-arms used! Quick!—let us on
to the <span lang="fr">Champ de Mars!</span>”</p>

<p>We left the house to the care of Catherine and the old
grandmother and set off in haste for the Porte St. Honoré.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XLIII">CHAPTER XLIII.<br>
<span class="fs70">THE RED FLAG.</span></h2>


<p>Upon our arrival, the <span lang="fr">Champ de Mars</span> presented an
aspect of the most profound tranquillity.</p>

<p>A strong detachment of troops, with two or three pieces
of cannon, which had been stationed there in consequence
of the assassination which had taken place in the morning,
seeing that nothing extraordinary took place, gradually withdrew,
leaving the place to three or four hundred inoffensive
strollers, and a small group of men, to whom no one paid
the slightest attention, but which, like many small clouds,
contained a terrific tempest.</p>

<p>This group seemed to have as leaders two strange-looking
individuals. One of these creatures, whose name was Verriéres,
was a fantastic-looking hunchback. He had not
been seen since the 5th and 6th of October, when he
had made himself conspicuous at Versailles. He reappeared,
however, on the night before our present date.</p>

<p>The other was from the department of Auvergne, and
called Fournier, the American, because he had been overseer of
a negro plantation in St. Domingo.</p>

<p>He held in his hand a firelock.</p>

<p>The miserable creatures who were listening to the harangue
of these two men were a sort of human larva, arising
none knew from where.</p>

<p>On entering the <span lang="fr">Champ de Mars</span> we threw a glance
around, to see if we could recognise, in the midst of these
three or four hundred strollers, the four persons we came
in search of. At that moment, it was all the easier to do
so, as every one was following Lanterre to the altar of the
country. We followed as the rest. Lanterre announced
to the patriots, with a voice which suited admirably these
sort of proceedings, that the petition placed there the preceding
night could not be signed, as, at the moment this
petition was written, it was supposed that the Assembly
had not yet decided the fate of the King, but that, since
then, they had recognised his innocence and inviolability
in the sitting of the night before. The Jacobins, he continued,
intended occupying themselves with the forming a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_240"></a>[240]</span>
new petition, which they would, ere long, present for signature.</p>

<p>This declaration was received with murmurs.</p>

<p>“Why should we await the presentation of a petition
already formed? Don’t we know, as well as Messieurs
Brissot, Laclos, and Robespierre, what we want?” said an
enormous man, of about forty years of age, a young and
beautiful woman leaning on his arm. “We can also
write,” added he, with a smile; “and I might even say
that we commence to think.”</p>

<p>“No one hinders you. Citizen Robert,” said Lanterre,
who was, probably, not annoyed at the interruption. “You,
and, above all, the Citizen Keralio, whose dear little arm
you have the extreme felicity of squeezing within your
own, are more capable of success than any one else. In
the meantime, I take possession of the one made by the
Society.”</p>

<p>So saying, Lanterre placed in his pocket the petition
written by me, dictated by Brissot, amended by Laclos, and
definitely corrected by Bonneville and Camille Desmoulins.</p>

<p>“With all this, I neither see my wife nor my daughters,”
exclaimed M. Duplay.</p>

<p>“I have an idea,” replied I, “that, having required
some refreshments, she went to some <i lang="fr">café</i> with Félicién.”</p>

<p>“We require pen, ink, and paper,” said the citizen
whom Lanterre had called Robert, “which we will find at
the first stationer’s.”</p>

<p>“Would you wish me to go and fetch it for you?” said
a red-headed individual, with a strong German accent.</p>

<p>“But,” said a strange voice, “do you think you can
spare time to go such a distance? How would it be, in the
meantime, if the Queen required your services?”</p>

<p>“The Queen!—the Queen!” demanded the people from
all sides, and at the same time fixing their eyes on the man
with the red hair.</p>

<p>“Yes. Why, the Citizen Weder is the <i lang="fr">valet-de-chambre</i>
of the Queen, and has come here, probably, to see what
was going on, so that he might be enabled to carry it to her
Majesty. If I make a mistake, and you are not the Citizen
Weder, say what your name is.”</p>

<p>“My name is Chaumette, a medical student, of No. 9,
Rue Mazarine. Let every one do as I have done, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_241"></a>[241]</span>
make known his name, then we shall be acquainted with
who are our friends, and who are our enemies.”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes, let every one say who he is,” said a man of
about eight-and-twenty, whose black beard seemed to have
added to the sternness of his features. “My name is
Brune, a typographical worker; and, if futurity could be
seen into,” he might have added, “a future Marshal of
France.”</p>

<p>“And if you want a printer for your petition, here am I,
Momoro, the printer of liberty!”</p>

<p>“And I, Hébert, journalist, Rue Mirabeau.”</p>

<p>Then succeeded such tumultuous uproar of men shrieking
their names with all their force, that one could scarcely
distinguish those of Renouard, Lagarde, Moreau, Henriot,
Laschereau, and David.</p>

<p>When this tempestuous noise ceased, the man named
Weder had disappeared.</p>

<p>“M. Robert,” said I to him who had offered to frame the
text of the petition, “I have some business in yonder <i lang="fr">café</i>,
where I fancy I can distinguish some of my friends, whence
I will proceed to the nearest stationer’s, and bring you
back everything that is necessary for writing purposes.”
Then I added to M. Duplay, “Follow me with your eyes,
sir; and if, as I believe, those are the ladies we are in
search of, I will make you a sign with my pocket-handkerchief.”</p>

<p>As I had fancied, it was Madame Duplay and her
daughters. I told them where I had left M. Duplay, and
asked them to go and meet him at the altar of the country.
I then proceeded to the stationer’s, and bought two or three
sheets of paper, knowing very well that if even there was
only one sheet required for the petition itself, there would
be one hundred or one hundred and fifty signatures. I
also bought a bottle of ink and a packet of pens already
cut.</p>

<p>When returning, I met with M. Duplay and his family.
This gentleman, fearing some serious disorder, was taking
his family home by the nearest road—that is to say, by the
Invalides. Before separating with him, though, I promised
that if anything grave took place, I would return with a
full account to the house.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_242"></a>[242]</span></p>

<p>I now hastened to the altar, where I was impatiently
awaited.</p>

<p>I have already mentioned the names of Robert and Mademoiselle
Keralio. Notwithstanding how well posted we
are at the present moment in the history of the Revolution,
very few persons are acquainted with the very prominent
part taken by these two persons in the proceedings of that
terrible day, the 17th of July, which killed with the one
blow the absolute royalty, which it ought to have raised
from its low position, and the constitutional royalty, which
it ought to have upheld, and which, directed against the
Jacobins, whom it ought to have extinguished, gave them,
on the contrary, an additional strength.</p>

<p>Robert, as I have said, was an enormous man, of forty or
forty-five years of age. Being a member of the Club of
the Cordeliers, he vainly searched with his eyes some of his
colleagues of reputation. Either by accident, or otherwise,
he did not succeed in finding a single one of these. On
the Saturday evening, Danton was obliged to join a meeting
in the wood of Vincennes, and thence he went on to
Fontenoy, where his father-in-law was a street vender of
lemonade. Legendre had left about the same time, with
Camille Desmoulins, and Féron. A meeting had been
arranged at Fontenoy, by Danton, and all four dined there
together.</p>

<p>A great responsibility was, therefore, about to be placed
on the shoulders of Robert; he would be obliged to represent
alone, or nearly so, the entire Club of the Cordeliers.
We must, however, agree that he accepted his position
bravely. The Club of the Jacobins was totally out of the
question, since Lanterre, in the name of the Society, had
come and withdrawn the petition.</p>

<p>As to the wife of Robert, Mademoiselle Keralio was a
young lady—very gay, lively, talented. She was a Breton,
and daughter of a Chevalier de St. Louis, called Guniement
de Keralio. As inspector of the military colleges of
France, he had, on paying a visit to the college at Brienne,
given a favorable account of a young Corsican, named
Bonaparte—he who afterwards became the Great Napoleon.</p>

<p>His calling not being sufficient for the support of his
family, he made translations, and wrote for several journals,
among others for the <cite lang="fr">Mercure</cite>, and <cite lang="fr">Journal des Savants</cite>.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_243"></a>[243]</span>
His daughter assisted him to the best of her powers. At
eighteen years of age, she wrote a novel, called “Adelaide;”
then the “History of Elizabeth,” a long and
serious work; afterwards she married Robert, a great
friend of Camille Desmoulins, and an enemy of Lafayette,
who had written a book, entitled, “Republicanism adapted
to France.” Not less patriotic than her husband, Madame
Robert had come with him to add her signature to the
petition, declaring that France neither recognised Louis XVI
nor any other King; and seeing that it had been withdrawn,
she was the first to advise her husband to draw up
another.</p>

<p>I had no sooner arrived on the spot with my pens, ink,
and paper, than she snatched them from my hands with
such gracious vivacity, that I could really say nothing, but
thank her. She then handed a pen to her husband, who
was not very clever at composition.</p>

<p>“Write, write,” said she, “what I dictate.”</p>

<p>Then, amidst thunders of applause, and while consulting
some with her eyes, and others with words and signs, she
set to work to dictate, clearly, and with much eloquence, a
petition for the dethronement of the King, which was at
the same time a violent charge against royalty.</p>

<p>The affair was done, and well done, in less than three-quarters
of an hour.</p>

<p>Robert, who had written the petition, signed it first and
passed the pen to his neighbor.</p>

<p>Every one wished for the pen. I had a packet, which I
distributed; and as it would take too long for them to sign
one after the other, so dense had the mass become, the idea
struck me to distribute the three extra sheets of paper,
each of which could contain two hundred signatures.</p>

<p>No doubt, the assembly had heard from Weder what was
going on on the <span lang="fr">Champ de Mars</span>. The situation was
grave; for if the people broke the decrees of the Assembly,
it would cease being the first power of the State.</p>

<p>There was not a moment to be lost. The meeting would
have to be dissolved, and the petition destroyed at all
risks; the more so, as every instant the mob was becoming
more and more numerous; not from the side of Paris,
where it was made known to all, that, by proceeding to the
<span lang="fr">Champ de Mars</span>, they would be guilty of an act of rebellion,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_244"></a>[244]</span>
but from the village of D’Yssy, Vaugirard, Sevres,
St. Cloud, and Boulogne, where they were foretold of the
reunion, and had not heard of any counter-petition. They
flocked to it, as to a <span lang="fr">fête</span>.</p>

<p>The intentions were good, although nothing was easier
than to accuse them of being bad. The Assembly—duped
either by mistake, or profiting by the occasion—sent a message
to the Mayor, announcing that a band of fifty thousand
robbers were congregated in the <span lang="fr">Champ de Mars</span>, and
were about to march upon the <span lang="fr">Salle du Manège</span>.</p>

<p>They called to their protection a military body, and gave
the order to Bailly to disperse the brigands by force.
Bailly, who was not aware of the goings on, and who
should, before all other things, obey the orders of the Assembly,
forewarned Lafayette, and sounded the alarm.</p>

<p>In these times, the paid guard, strongly addicted to aristocratic—or,
rather, Lafayettish—principles, for it was
nearly entirely composed of the conquerors of the Bastille,
were always the first to answer such a call.</p>

<p>This body, perfectly armed and perfectly commanded,
were exasperated at the injuries they received from the
Democratic journals, and particularly the <cite>Friend of the
People</cite>, of Marat, in which he called them the spies of Lafayette;
and one day demanded their noses to be cut
off, another day their ears, and even hinted at finishing
with them altogether with the assistance of the guillotine.</p>

<p>They applauded vociferously, when suddenly the red flag
was seen to float from the balcony of the <span lang="fr">Hotel de Ville</span>,
which was a signal to all the loyal citizens of the town of
their help, and never did they require help more than on
this occasion.</p>

<p>In the midst of these cries, the Mayor, who was pale as
the day on which he marched to the scaffold, descended the
<span lang="fr">Place de Grève</span>, and placed himself at the head of a
column of the National Guard. Lafayette, at the head of
another column, followed the left bank of the Seine, while
Bailly took the right bank.</p>

<p>The red flag was unhooked, and followed the column,
headed by the Mayor.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XLIV">CHAPTER XLIV.<br>
<span class="fs70">THE MASSACRE OF THE <span lang="fr">CHAMP DE MARS</span>.</span></h2>


<p>We thought but little of the danger we were running at
the <span lang="fr">Champ de Mars</span>, and knew nothing whatever of what
was going on at the <span lang="fr">Hotel de Ville</span>. The crowd was nothing
more than an ordinary Sunday crowd. No weapons
whatever were to be seen, save the sabres hanging to the
belts of some stray National Guards, who might be taking
a walk with their wives and children. Madame Roland
says, in her “Memoirs,” that she remained there till ten
o’clock.</p>

<p>The only extraordinary proceeding that took place was
that on the altar.</p>

<p>They continued to sign the petition with a vigor that
promised twelve or fifteen hundred signatures before night-fall.
Generally the person signing cried out, “Vive la
nation! Down with royalty!” threw his cap up in the
air, and ceded the place to another.</p>

<p>Two contrary currents were established on the north,
south, and east sides of the altar of the country, between
the persons ascending and the persons descending. The
height of the altar was immense—that it is to say, about
one hundred feet. At about four o’clock in the afternoon,
it presented the aspect of an enormous hive, swarming with
bees.</p>

<p>At a few minutes past four o’clock, we heard the drums,
but paid little attention to them, the affair of the hair-dresser
and Invalid having for some time escaped the memory
of every one. In Paris, one soon forgets the events
which are of but little interest to remember. There was
simply a movement of curiosity on the altar, where two
thousand people were seated, and on the ground of the
<span lang="fr">Champ de Mars</span>, where some ten to twelve thousand were
walking.</p>

<p>These drums were those of a battalion of the advanced
guard of the Faubourg St. Antoine. This battalion was
totally misinformed of what was taking place in the Champ
de Mars. They had received an order from Bailly and Lafayette<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_246"></a>[246]</span>
to fire in case of any resistance being made, but
only in case of resistance.</p>

<p>Before entering the <span lang="fr">Champ de Mars</span>, the command was
given to halt, and load their guns. They thought they
would have to face some fifty thousand brigands, determined
on bloodshed and pillage.</p>

<p>They found, on the contrary, an inoffensive population
amusing itself.</p>

<p>The battalion halted a second time; but, as they did not
find what they were in search of, they put their guns in
clusters, and sent a few unarmed grenadiers to see what
was passing on the altar of the country. These came back,
saying that they were signing a petition in the greatest
possible order, and without the slightest noise.</p>

<p>The people walking in the <span lang="fr">Champ de Mars</span> did not, on
their side, pay the slightest attention to the arrival of the
military from the <span lang="fr">Faubourg St. Antoine</span>.</p>

<p>But about the same time, the drums of <span lang="fr">Gros Caillon</span> and
the <span lang="fr">Cours la Reine</span> were heard calling to arms.</p>

<p>From <span lang="fr">Gros Caillon</span> it was Lafayette, and from <span lang="fr">Cours la
Reine</span>, Bailly, who arrived with the National and paid
Guards.</p>

<p>Lafayette sent, in advance, an aide-de-camp and a hundred
armed men, to find out what was really passing in the
<span lang="fr">Champ de Mars</span>. But from the group, which I have
already mentioned as having been commanded by Verriéres
and Fournier, a gun-shot was seen to proceed, which
wounded the aide-de-camp of Lafayette.</p>

<p>The advance guard returned to Lafayette, and the aide-de-camp,
bleeding, made his report on the manner in which
he was received.</p>

<p>To him, wounded as he was on his entry into the Champs,
all the inoffensive strollers appeared to be brigands.</p>

<p>Lafayette placed himself at the head of the three thousand
men he commanded, and marched on the Champ de
Mars.</p>

<p>He found Fournier, Verriéres, and those they led, busily
engaged in raising a barricade. He marched straight up to
the barricade, and destroyed it. From under a cart, Fournier,
the American, fired through one of the wheels on Lafayette.</p>

<p>The gun missed fire.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_247"></a>[247]</span></p>

<p>Fournier, the American, was taken, and charged with
revolt and homicide.</p>

<p>The National Guard would have shot him on the spot,
had not Lafayette torn him from their hands, and rendered
him his liberty.</p>

<p>The most curious of all was, that this bloody day was
caused by these two bloodthirsty men, Lafayette and
Bailly.</p>

<p>The battalion from the Faubourg St. Antoine and Marias
entered the Champ at the same time as Lafayette, and
ranged themselves behind the altar, in front of the Military
College.</p>

<p>Lafayette, fearing that these might sympathise with the
people, sent a detachment of the National Guard to join
them.</p>

<p>At this moment the promenaders, and those who were
signing the petition on the altar, preoccupied, but not
alarmed, at the sort of collision which had taken place
between the National Guard and the defenders of the barricade,
saw, advancing by the Bridge of Bois (to-day the
Bridge of Jéna) another body of the army, headed by the
Mayor, and over the heads of which floated the red flag.</p>

<p>This red flag informed us that martial law was proclaimed.</p>

<p>Against whom?</p>

<p>It could not be against those who were guilty of no
wrong, and who were simply walking by right of the
petition accorded to every citizen.</p>

<p>In the midst of the troop following the Mayor were to be
distinguished a company of dragoons. The dragoons were
well known to be an aristocratic regiment, being used to
firing on the people. Also a band of hair-dressers, armed to
the teeth, with their hair dressed <i lang="fr">à l’aile de pigeon</i> and
clad in the height of fashion. Their clothes were of silks
and satin, and of every color in the rainbow.</p>

<p>They came, no doubt, to avenge the death of that unfortunate
poor fellow, Léger.</p>

<p>The group which had opposed the entrance of Lafayette
had gone and reformed themselves a little further off.
They were joined by all the blackguards of the quarter.</p>

<p>At the moment when, after a roll of drums, M. Bailly
commenced his declaration, a shower of stones fell around<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_248"></a>[248]</span>
him. A gun was fired behind him at the same time, and
wounded a dragoon.</p>

<p>Bailly gave the order to fire a round of blank cartridge
in the air. The order was executed. This inoffensive discharge
injured no one, but had the effect of making Lafayette
think that it was real.</p>

<p>The promenaders nearly all rushed towards the altar of
the country, fancying that they, as simple spectators, could
not be fired upon without there having first been a summons
to disperse.</p>

<p>At this moment, the <span lang="fr">Champ de Mars</span> was invaded by cavalry.</p>

<p>The promenaders vainly search for an issue to re-enter
Paris.</p>

<p>At all sides, nothing but troubles present themselves to
our view; at the Military College, at Gros Caillon, at the
entrance to the wood.</p>

<p>Almost immediately the paid guards made an offensive
movement towards the altar. Abandoning the hostile
group, which continued to shower stones on their heads,
they dashed themselves distractedly and furiously against
the altar; and, without an attack, without provocation or resistance,
fired on this mass of brothers—this living pyramid,
this human beehive, of which two-thirds were composed of
defenceless women and children.</p>

<p>The hurricane of fire fell on this disarmed throng, who
only replied by heart-rending cries of agony. The three
faces of the altar were covered with the dead and wounded
bodies of the unfortunate victims.</p>

<p>From the height of the pyramid where I found myself—between
Robert and his wife,—I perceived that the artillery
were about to make fire on the people with the cannon, at
the risk of firing on the cavaliers and paid guard, when
Lafayette perceiving the movement, dug the spurs into his
horse, and galloped to the mouth of the cannon, where he
placed himself.</p>

<p>The first cry of Madame Robert was—“’Tis on the petitioners
they would fire! Let us save the petition!” Then
addressing herself to me, she said, “Help me, monsieur—help
me!”</p>

<p>It was no longer a question of signing; every one precipitated
himself by the only side of the altar which had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_249"></a>[249]</span>
not been fired upon—that is to say, the side facing the
Military College, and which was protected by the battalions
of the Faubourg St. Antoine and Marais. Both the petition
and the sheets, covered with signatures, were seen to
fly before the wind.</p>

<p>Madame Robert took possession of the petition, whilst
her husband and I collected about a hundred sheets of signatures.</p>

<p>We then descended by the west side of the altar.</p>

<p>Around us, seven or eight persons had been killed or
wounded.</p>

<p>A hundred and fifty, at least, fell before this first discharge.</p>

<p>In descending this immense staircase, I lost Robert and
his wife. The National Guards of the Faubourg St. Antoine
and Marais cried, “Come with us—we will defend
you!”</p>

<p>I rushed to their sides; the dragoons set out in pursuit
of us; but the battalion of the Marais opened their ranks
to us, and prepared to receive them with the bayonet. An
aide-de-camp came up, and ordered this battalion to march
forward, and make a junction with the other troops. The
aide-de-camp was killed. None obeyed this order but the
paid guards.</p>

<p>The battalion, or rather, the two battalions, of National
Guards, formed themselves into two columns, sent out scouts,
so as to protect any fugitives who might come and ask for
shelter in their ranks, and marched from the Champ de
Mars, leaving this horrible butchery to be completed without
their assistance.</p>

<span class="fs70">ROBESPIERRE PAYS A VISIT TO M. DUPLAY.</span></h2>


<p>I had no sooner quitted this frightful scene of bloodshed,
than, thanking my saviors, I sprang forward towards the
river, in order to cross it by boat, or, if there was a necessity,
to swim it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_250"></a>[250]</span></p>

<p>The affair seemed to me grave. There must have been
some treachery on foot, of which, in my mind the Jacobins
ought to be instructed.</p>

<p>There happened to be, in a boat anchored to the river’s
bank, a man fishing, who did not disturb himself, notwithstanding
the thundering of the cannon.</p>

<p>Nothing ever disturbs a man fishing. To untie the rope,
jump into the boat, and take possession of the oars, was
but the work of a few moments. I had nearly half-way
crossed the river before he recovered from his astonishment.</p>

<p>At length, he demanded what I meant by this violence,
both to himself and to his boat? I showed him a paper,
and said, “An order from General Lafayette.” That was
sufficient.</p>

<p>I jumped out on the right bank, leaving the boat, with
its owner, to regain the left.</p>

<p>Once on solid ground, I took to my heels, and by Cours
la Reine, and the Porte St. Honoré, I set out for M. Duplay’s
house as fast as my legs could carry me.</p>

<p>From <span lang="fr">Cours la Reine</span> to the Church of the Assumption,
in front of which M. Duplay lived, I found the streets
greatly agitated and full of people.</p>

<p>The red flag, the Mayor, the dragoons, and the paid
guard were seen to pass; then, again, they had heard the
terrible discharge of musketry; so that seeing me come
from the <span lang="fr">Champ de Mars</span>, running, the perspiration dropping
off me, and all covered with blood, every one inquired
of me the whole way along,—“What is the matter?”</p>

<p>I had but one reply to make, and that while I was running.</p>

<p>“The dragoons and the paid guard are slaughtering the
people!”</p>

<p>I found M. Duplay at his door, surrounded by a group of
neighbors and acquaintances. I related to him all that
had taken place.</p>

<p>“Oh, ho!” said he; “the Jacobins must be informed of
this. Quick!—let us run to the club!”</p>

<p>About fifty members awaited the news with impatience.
They had, as yet, heard nothing. I was the first messenger
of the mournful intelligence.</p>

<p>They said that M. Robespierre must at once be informed,
and a messenger was despatched to the Assembly to fetch
him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_251"></a>[251]</span></p>

<p>The Jacobins knew one fact, and that was, that all the
blame would be left on their shoulders. It was they who
had taken the initiative in the affair of the petition. The
Constitutionals, who had separated from them, in order to
form the new clubs Feuillants, washed their hands of this
popular movement in opposition to the decree of the
Assembly.</p>

<p>They thanked M. Duplay and myself, and refused to
recognise any petition tending to the dethronement of the
King. Everything was circulated in the name of the
Assembly, and the society swore anew fidelity to the Constitution
and submission to the decrees of the Assembly.</p>

<p>After what had presented itself to my view the preceding
days, and after what I had written at the dictation of
Citizen Brissot, I found this submission too prompt. There
was at the bottom of it all an abandonment of the rights
of the people, and a cowardice which disgusted me.</p>

<p>I left the club, and returned pensively to the house.</p>

<p>A half an hour or so after, might be heard a great disturbance
towards the Place Louis XV.</p>

<p>It was the paid guard, who were re-entering Paris by
the Rue St. Honoré, to have an occasion to make a demonstration
against the Jacobins.</p>

<p>One had hardly the time to form palisades.</p>

<p>The paid guard collected themselves before the Convent,
demanding powder to blow the gate and demolish the den
of the Republicans. They were laughed at; they were
applauded; they were hissed. The street was full of people,
looking at one another, ready to come to blows.</p>

<p>It was plain to be seen that one of those misunderstandings
had taken place which places the gun to one’s shoulder
without one’s knowing upon whom to fire.</p>

<p>All at once, I could perceive, in the Rue Luxembourg, a
man gliding down the street, with an evident desire to pass
unnoticed.</p>

<p>I pulled my master’s coat, and whispered to him, “The
Citizen Robespierre.”</p>

<p>It was indeed none other but he, who had been sent to
the Assembly, and who had arrived there just in time to
have the door shut on his nose.</p>

<p>It was evident that if he was recognised by the paid
guard, he would run the risk of being shot.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_252"></a>[252]</span></p>

<p>He was at this moment recognised by a group of persons,
and cheered. No doubt, they were Jacobins.</p>

<p>He quickened his pace, descending the street, to gain
speedily the Faubourg St. Honoré.</p>

<p>At the <span lang="fr">Rue de Luxembourg</span>, several cries were raised of
“<span lang="fr">Vive Robespierre!</span>”</p>

<p>He turned pale, and hesitated whether to take the Luxembourg
or continue his road. He continued.</p>

<p>“<span lang="fr">Vive Robespierre!</span>” again cried a man. “And since
it is absolutely necessary to have a King, why not have
him?”</p>

<p>Robespierre thought himself lost. He looked on all sides
for shelter.</p>

<p>Duplay rushed towards him.</p>

<p>“At my house—at my house, citizen!” said he. “My
name is Duplay! I am master carpenter, and a good
citizen!”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes—at our house!” said Madame Duplay and
Mademoiselle Cornelie.</p>

<p>And all three—the man and the two women—surrounded
Robespierre, who, without the slightest resistance, allowed
himself to be led into the alley.</p>

<p>I entered last, and locked the door.</p>

<p>The retreat was effected so prudently, that hardly a soul
had perceived the manœuvre.</p>

<p>Those that did see him said nothing, so that no noise was
made at the door.</p>

<p>Robespierre was extremely pale. He sat down, or rather
fell, on the first chair that came in his way. Mademoiselle
Cornelie wiped his forehead with her pocket-handkerchief,
while Madame Duplay brought him a glass of fresh water.</p>

<p>I placed the glass to his lips, but his hand shook so, that
he made the glass chink against his teeth.</p>

<p>However he drank, looked around him, tried to smile, and
said, “I see that I am with friends.”</p>

<p>“Say, rather, with admirers—with devoted admirers!”
replied M. Duplay.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes!” replied the three women.</p>

<p>“Oh, if I had known it,” said M. Duplay, “I would not
have allowed you to present yourself at the National Assembly.”</p>

<p>“How so?” said Robespierre.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_253"></a>[253]</span></p>

<p>“Yes; it was Réné,”—M. Duplay pointed me out,—“it
was Réné, a good young man, a staunch patriot, and a friend
of M. Drouet de St. Menehould, who, you know, arrested
the King; it was Réné who came and announced the massacre
on the <span lang="fr">Champ de Mars</span>. We have but one bond to
the Jacobins, and, as I belong to the club——”</p>

<p>“Ah, I now recognise you,” said Robespierre.</p>

<p>“Then it was decided to go and fetch you.”</p>

<p>“And I arrived just in time to see the gates shut. Not
wishing to return home, at the bottom of the Marais, I was
going to get a little shelter at the house of Pétion, who
lives in the Faubourg St. Honoré. You came across me on
my road, and brought me here. I ask permission to remain
here all night. Surrounded by the spies of Lafayette, and
satellites of Bailly, the life of an honest man runs great
danger. I do not fear death, but my ambition is to die in
a way useful to my country.”</p>

<p>I assisted at this scene without the slightest emotion.
It seemed to me a great honor to address this great man.</p>

<p>“Then,” said he, “you are the friend of the Citizen
Drouet?”</p>

<p>“He cared for me like a father,” said I. “The little
I know I owe to him and to Rousseau.”</p>

<p>“Ah, young man, you have Rousseau?”</p>

<p>“I know him by heart.”</p>

<p>“Good master—great master! I, also, was his scholar,
and I hope to do him credit one of these days.”</p>

<p>Duplay and his wife listened with their mouths open,
nearly on their knees.</p>

<p>For some time, Duplay seemed as if he wished to ask a
question. His wife and he had exchanged two or three significant
glances.</p>

<p>“Would the Citizen Robespierre do us the honor of supping
with us?”</p>

<p>“I would not trouble you so much,” said Robespierre.
“And then, again, my sister would be anxious.”</p>

<p>“But you were going to sup with the Citizen Pétion.”</p>

<p>“Yes; but from Pétion’s I could have let my sister
know.”</p>

<p>“Very well; she can be informed from here as well.”</p>

<p>“Have you any person certain?”</p>

<p>“There is me, citizen,” said I.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_254"></a>[254]</span></p>

<p>“Would you have that kindness?”</p>

<p>“I will be only too happy to render this service to
M. Duplay.”</p>

<p>“Then have the goodness to give me pen, ink, and paper.”</p>

<p>The two young girls brought him the pen and paper.</p>

<p>He wrote, in a small hand, the following:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<span class="smcap">My Sister</span>,—</p>

<p>“Don’t be uneasy. I am in safety.</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="padr6">“Your brother,</span><br>
<span class="smcap padr4">“Maximilian.”</span></p>
</div>

<p>He then sealed his letter, and wrote the address in a bold
hand, which reminded me greatly of his character,—</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="padr6"><i>To Mdlle. Charlotte de Robespierre.</i></span><br>
<span class="padr4"><i>No. 7 Rue Saintange</i></span><br>
<span class="padr2"><i>At the Marais.</i></span></p>

<p>I took the letter, and went on my mission.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XLVI">CHAPTER XLVI.<br>
<span class="fs70">INSTALLATION.</span></h2>


<p>I have already said that nature had gifted me with
strong legs, and it was in days like the present that I appreciated
the gift.</p>

<p>As yet, I knew not sufficient of Paris to be enabled to
extricate myself from the labyrinth of streets which joined
the Rue St. Honoré, and which stretched from the <span lang="fr">Rue
Aubry le Boucher</span> to the <span lang="fr">Rue Boucherat</span>, so that I spent
six or seven minutes in making the necessary inquiries, and
at last arrived.</p>

<p>I saw a sombre house in a sombre street. It was No. 7.
I mounted a dark-looking staircase, and arrived at the
second floor.</p>

<p>Three doors opened on the landing: one of them bore an
inscription:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_255"></a>[255]</span></p>

<p>“<span lang="fr">Le Citoyen Maximilian de Robespierre, et Deputé à
l’Assemblée Nationale</span>.”</p>

<p>I knocked.</p>

<p>I heard footsteps approaching the door, and then stop
cautiously.</p>

<p>“Is it you, Maximilian?” asked a voice, in which could
be discerned traces of emotion.</p>

<p>“No, mademoiselle,” I replied; “but I bring news of
him.”</p>

<p>The door was quickly opened.</p>

<p>“Nothing has happened to him?” asked a stately female
of about forty years.</p>

<p>“Here are a few words to reassure you,” I replied.</p>

<p>I then handed her the letter.</p>

<p>It was too dark for her to be enabled to read it in the
passage on the landing.</p>

<p>Mademoiselle de Robespierre re-entered the apartment,
inviting me to follow her.</p>

<p>I entered a sort of dining-room, opening on a study and
bed-room.</p>

<p>All was cold, cheerless, and almost unfurnished. If not
actually miserable, it was far below mediocrity.</p>

<p>Mademoiselle Robespierre read her brother’s letter.</p>

<p>“When my brother thinks it needless to tell me where
he is, he has his reasons. You have seen him, sir?”</p>

<p>“I have just left him, mademoiselle.”</p>

<p>“Nothing has happened to him?”</p>

<p>“Nothing.”</p>

<p>“Give him my congratulations, sir, and thank for me
those people who have been hospitable to him. I would
that, after the long walk you have had, I could offer you
refreshment; but my brother is so sober, and has such few
wants, that we have naught but water in the house.”</p>

<p>At this moment, the tramp of footsteps was heard in the
corridor. A woman showed herself at the door of the
dining-room, and, dimly, a man could be perceived behind
her.</p>

<p>Despite the semi-darkness, I recognised the female, and
could not resist crying out, “Madame Roland!”</p>

<p>Mademoiselle Robespierre repeated, in an accent of astonishment,
“Madame Roland!”</p>

<p>“Yes, I, myself, mademoiselle, and my husband, who,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_256"></a>[256]</span>
hearing that Robespierre has been threatened by his
enemies, are come to offer him a shelter in our little house
at the corner of the Rue Guenegaud.”</p>

<p>“I thank you in my brother’s name, madame,” replied
Mademoiselle Charlotte, with dignity. “He has already
found the asylum which you so nobly offer him, and which
I know not myself. Here is the gentleman who brought
the news,” continued she, pointing me out to Madame
Roland.</p>

<p>“That proves, mademoiselle,” said, in his turn, the
Citizen Roland, “that other citizens are more favored than
we;” and remarking that he was unwilling to intrude
longer on her privacy, he bowed, and departed with his
wife.</p>

<p>As my errand was fulfilled, I followed them, and returned
in close conversation with them. Madame Roland was at
the Jacobin Club when the paid guard made an irruption
among them.</p>

<p>The terror was such among the few members of the
society present, that one of them, anxious to escape, escaladed
the gallery set aside for women. Madame Roland
made him ashamed of himself, and compelled him to
descend the way that he had come.</p>

<p>They asked me about Robespierre. I told them that I
was not authorized to inform them of his place of shelter,
but only could assure them that he was in a place of safety
among people who would die for him.</p>

<p>Madame Roland asked me to tell Robespierre that they
would bring him to trial—that is to say, accuse him that
evening at the Feuillants. In that certainty, she and her
husband were going to M. Buzal, to pray him to defend his
colleague.</p>

<p>We separated at the top of the Pont Neuf—M. Roland
and Madame to go down the <span lang="fr">Rue du Roule</span>. I to follow
the <span lang="fr">Rue St. Honoré</span>.</p>

<p>It was quite night when I arrived at Duplay’s. Félicién
had rejoined the family during my absence; they were
at table, and he regarded askance the new arrival, who took
the place of honor between Madame Duplay and Mademoiselle
Cornelie. I told M. Robespierre all about the fulfilment
of my message, and reported to him his sister’s
reply.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_257"></a>[257]</span></p>

<p>I told him also that M. and Madame Roland had paid a
visit to his house.</p>

<p>Here he interrupted, and repeated after me,—“Citizen
Roland! Citizeness Roland!”</p>

<p>He appeared so astonished at the visit, that he was some
time asking me the cause.</p>

<p>I took my place at the table.</p>

<p>“Monsieur,” said Robespierre, after a moment’s silence,
with his habitual politeness, “does it please you to serve
me to the end?”</p>

<p>“Not only will it be an honor, and a pleasure,” replied
I, “but a duty.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said he, “this time you have only a few steps
to go, and I shall not have to write a letter. Go to the
Rue St. Anne; on the left-hand side, in going up the
street, by the Boulevards, you will see the <span lang="fr">Hotel de Berry</span>;
there you will inquire for a young man named St. Just.
He lives on the fourth floor, in a room overlooking the court.
If he be at home, tell him that I want him. My kind
host, I hope, will allow me to receive him here. At present,
this young man is of no account, but one day he will lead
us all. If he be not at home, well; you leave your name
and the address of this house, where I have found such
good friends, and such noble protectors, and under the address
you write, ‘Urgent for the sake of the public safety.’
Whenever he returns, he will come straight here, you may
be sure.”</p>

<p>I wished to leave the table, but, placing his hand on my
shoulder, he said, “Finish your supper. I am not in so
great a hurry, and we have all the night before us.”</p>

<p>Five minutes after, I was proceeding up the Rue St.
Anne.</p>

<p>The <span lang="fr">Hotel de Berry</span> led out of the <span lang="fr">Rue Neuve des Petits-champs</span>
and the <span lang="fr">Rue Neuve St. Augustin</span>.</p>

<p>I asked for Citizen St. Just.</p>

<p>The concierge threw his eyes over the keys hung on the
wall, and saw that of St. Just was not there.</p>

<p>“No. 19, fourth story, at the bottom of the corridor.”</p>

<p>I mounted a dark staircase, and found the indicated corridor,
and in that corridor, No. 19.</p>

<p>I knocked; a powerful voice said, “Come in!”</p>

<p>I turned the key in the lock, and saw a young man in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_258"></a>[258]</span>
his shirt-sleeves, working by an open window at the correction
of proofs.</p>

<p>He was so absorbed in his work, that I approached and
touched him before he turned round.</p>

<p>The book, the proofs of which he was correcting, was, I
could see, entitled, “<span lang="fr">Mespasse temps ou le Voirvel organe</span>.”</p>

<p>The preoccupation of the young poet was caused by the
desire to find a rhyme.</p>

<p>The rhyme found, he turned to me.</p>

<p>“Pardon,” said he; “what want you?”</p>

<p>“Citizen St. Just,” replied I, “I come on behalf of
Citizen Robespierre.”</p>

<p>“You?”</p>

<p>“Yes. He desires your presence immediately.”</p>

<p>“Where?”</p>

<p>“If you are not prepared, I will leave you the address;
but if you are, I will conduct you thither.”</p>

<p>“Is he at the Rue Saintange?”</p>

<p>“No; he is close by here—in the Rue St. Honoré.”</p>

<p>“At the Jacobins?”</p>

<p>“There are no longer Jacobins. The club is dead.”</p>

<p>“Who dared do it?”</p>

<p>“The paid guard, who, an hour before, dared do another
thing.”</p>

<p>“What was the other thing?”</p>

<p>“Fire on the people at the <span lang="fr">Champ de Mars</span>—slay, perchance,
six or seven hundred persons!”</p>

<p>St. Just shouted with rage.</p>

<p>“What! you a patriot—the friend of M. Robespierre,—and
not know better than that what takes place in Paris?”
said I.</p>

<p>“I promised my publisher to have those proofs corrected
by Thursday; and in order to accomplish this I told the
servant not to disturb me for anything. He brought my
breakfast in my chamber, and here is my dinner already
served. I have not had time to eat. I knew last night
from the Jacobins they must withdraw the petition; and I
doubted not that, the petition withdrawn, there might be a
disturbance at the <span lang="fr">Champ de Mars</span>. But let us not lose a
moment. Since Robespierre requires me, I am at his
orders.”</p>

<p>The young man put on a white waistcoat, irreproachable<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_259"></a>[259]</span>
in its cleanliness; a gray coat; a sword and dagger he
hung at his side; then took his hat, and said but the
words, “Show the way!”</p>

<p>I went in front, and he followed.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XLVII">CHAPTER XLVII.<br>
<span class="fs70">A BREAK.</span></h2>


<p>Here comes a break in my personal adventures during
the course of the great struggle for liberty throughout
France. I leading the way, and St. Just following, we
went down the Rue St. Anne, and had almost reached the
<span lang="fr">Rue Neuve des Augustins</span>, when the powerful voice of St.
Just (one that was soon to be heard by the Nation, which
was to hush at his first word) addressed me.</p>

<p>“Citizen!”</p>

<p>“Citizen St. Just?”</p>

<p>“Give me the address whither we are going!” he said.</p>

<p>“Why, I am leading you! Do you mistrust me?”</p>

<p>His face flushed.</p>

<p>“I mistrust no man,” he replied.</p>

<p>“Then why do you ask for the address?”</p>

<p>“By way of precaution.”</p>

<p>“What need is there of precaution?”</p>

<p>“Was not the Citizen Robespierre in danger not an hour
since, by being in the streets?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Then the Citizen St. Just is equally in danger of a bullet
from the barrel of a paid guard.”</p>

<p>“I shall not desert you.”</p>

<p>“But——”</p>

<p>“Yes, citizen.”</p>

<p>“What if <em>you</em> are killed?” St. Just replied calmly. “I
should not know whither you came.”</p>

<p>“True,” I replied; and he taking out his tablets, wrote
upon them, from my dictation, the address of the Citizen
Duplay.</p>

<p>In this act may be seen an example of that forethought<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_260"></a>[260]</span>
and preparation which gave St. Just a position to which
otherwise he never would have attained.</p>

<p>“Good!” he said, having carefully taken down every
particular. “Go forward.”</p>

<p>How necessary was his precaution, the next few minutes
showed.</p>

<p>We had only reached the end of the Rue St. Anne, when
a sudden rush of people along the <span lang="fr">Rue Neuve des Augustins</span>
warned us that danger was at hand.</p>

<p>I turned and looked at St. Just.</p>

<p>Without regarding me, while apparently his sight was on
the alert on all sides, he repeated his direction, “Go forward.”</p>

<p>Suddenly, shots were heard, and, in a few moments, the
street surged with people, who poured out from the houses
and joined those who were speeding down the street, running
by their sides and asking what the commotion meant.
So far, very few of the citizens were aware of the massacres
that had taken place upon the altar of the country.</p>

<p>Paris, in fact, was that day, for the first time, wholly
shadowed by the red flag—which was not to be furled again
until a reign of terror, never equalled in the history of the
world, was to be followed by the inauguration of Napoleon’s
splendor.</p>

<p>We were proceeding as rapidly as possible past the current
of excited people, when, unquestionably, a deadly fire
opened from a small turning on the left.</p>

<p>Suddenly, I turned to the left, to see who had struck me;
for I felt that a blow had been aimed at my shoulder which
had nearly sent me off my feet.</p>

<p>As I turned, no man faced me, and I was wondering where
the blow came from; when, as suddenly and unexpectedly
as I received the blow, I felt sick and weak.</p>

<p>It was a woman who screamed, “Blood!”</p>

<p>She pointed to the ground.</p>

<p>As though looking through a mist, I followed the direction
of her pointing finger.</p>

<p>There was blood upon the ground.</p>

<p>All this had passed in a space not longer than six moments.</p>

<p>“Citizen” said the voice of St. Just, “you are wounded;
the ball, however, was meant for me.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_261"></a>[261]</span></p>

<p>The last words sounded faintly in my ears, and I thought
that he, too, was hurt.</p>

<p>“And you, citizen—are you wounded?”</p>

<p>“No,” he replied, in a still fainter voice, as it appeared
to me; but it was my senses forsaking me.</p>

<p>“Citizens,” I heard him say, “if I fall, you will find an
address in my pocket, which is the home of this lad.”</p>

<p>That was all I heard. Suddenly, the earth appeared to
slip from under me, and there was an end of my consciousness.</p>

<p>When next I knew myself, I awoke to life with the feeling
of a beating red-hot hammer upon my left shoulder; I
appeared to be struggling out of a state of fearful horror.
When this cleared off and I knew myself to be once more
alive, once more Citizen Réné Besson, I was in a little room,
which I soon learnt was an apartment belonging to Citizen
Duplay; and, at my side, reading a book, was Citizeness
Cornelie Duplay, who had constituted herself my nurse.</p>

<p>And inasmuch as this history is not so much one of myself
as of the Revolution, and of my part in it, I will only
briefly recount the events of the next few weeks—of the
next few months, in relation to myself.</p>

<p>It appeared that I had been wounded in the shoulder,
not dangerously; but the loss of blood was very great, and
I was weak as a little child. I could not raise my hand
even to my head, while I had scarcely voice sufficient with
which to thank my kind nurse for the offices she performed
about me.</p>

<p>For weeks I lay upon that narrow bed, my constitution,
and the temperate life I had hitherto led, fighting well in
my favor. I could tell through chapters how gradually the
memory of Sophie Gerbaut faded from my mind, and of how
Cornelie Duplay took her place in my heart.</p>

<p>But I said nothing of my love; and when, weak, but
quite safe, I sat once more at Citizen Duplay’s hospitable
table, I still kept my passion to myself.</p>

<p>Released, however, as I was, from my bed, I was still a
prisoner in the house, which I did not quit for a couple
more months.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the Revolution was progressing.</p>

<p>The sight of the altar of the country, after the flight of
the people from its steps, was terrible. It is said that the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_262"></a>[262]</span>
great mass of the dead lying bleeding upon that mighty
structure was composed of women and children.</p>

<p>As the National Guard marched back to the city, after
this massacre of many hundreds—a massacre which would
have been multiplied by ten, had not Lafayette thrown
himself before the cannon—they were greeted with low
cries of “Murder!” “Murder!” “Vengeance!”</p>

<p>That day utterly parted the people from the thought of
royalty. Paris was now ready to spill blood, for massacre
would now take the name of vengeance. In many a street
in the common parts of Paris were to be found the surviving
relatives of those who had been slain. These were
naturally prompted by a spirit of revenge—by a determination
to pay blood with blood.</p>

<p>Nothing could wash out this hate—no words uttered by
the weak and vacillating King could now stem the torrent
of hate. Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette were already
condemned to death in the hearts of the people. Nothing
could save them.</p>

<p>The people were now ripe for rage, and therefore the
terrible Danton gained power. The total reverse of Robespierre,
they were to rise to power together. Robespierre
was feeble, small, thin, and excessively temperate. Habitually,
he ate little, drank water, and used perfumes when
he was not surrounded by flowers; for he was as passionate
an admirer of flowers as Mirabeau himself. Danton, on
the other hand, was a huge monster—athletic, rude, coarse.
He pleased the worst rabble of the city, because he resembled
them. His eloquence was as thunder, and his very
phrases were short, clear, and plain, like the words of a
general accustomed to command. His very gestures intoxicated
the people, who, however, more than by anything,
were attracted by his wit, which, coarse, brutal, and often
unjust, was never obscure, and always to the point. Men
who went to hear his wit, remained to be converted to his
ways of thinking.</p>

<p>His one quality was ambition—his one passion, excitement.
He was quite devoid of honor, principles, or morality—he
was already drunk with the Revolution; but it
was a drunkenness which produced madness—not sleep.
Moreover, he had the peculiar power of controlling himself
even in his most excited moments—times when he would<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_263"></a>[263]</span>
launch a bitter joke in the midst of his denunciations—a
joke which should compel his hearers to yell with laughter,
while he himself remained perfectly impassive. He
laughed contemptuously at all honesty. He despised a
man who could pity. In a word, he was a wild beast gifted
with speech, but who could no more think beyond himself
and his wants or desires, than can the beasts that perish.</p>

<p>The first great act of the people after the massacre upon
the altar of the country, was the expression of a desire to
honor the remains of Voltaire—the man whose writings,
together with those of Rousseau, had actually sown the
seed of revolution against that royalty which in Gaul and
France had unceasingly mastered the people through two
weary thousand years, before the death of Voltaire, in 1778—thirteen
years before the events I am now recording.
The power of the Court and the Church still maintained
such sway over the minds and hearts of the people, that it
was impossible to hope to bury the great man without
creating a popular outrage. His nephew, therefore, secretly
removed the body from Paris, where Voltaire died, and
bore it far away to the Abbey of Sellières, in Champagne,
where it found a resting-place.</p>

<p>Now it was the National Assembly ordered the removal
of Voltaire’s remains to the Pantheon, the cathedral of
philosophy, where lie buried many great men—that building
upon the face of which has been carved “France, in
gratitude to great men.”</p>

<p>“The people owe their freedom to Voltaire!” cried
Regnault de St. Jean d’Angely; “for by enlightening
them he gave them power. Nations are enthralled by
ignorance alone; and when the torch of reason displays to
them the ignominy of bearing these chains, they blush to
wear them, and they snap them asunder!”</p>

<p>Like a conqueror, seated on his trophies, they placed
Voltaire’s coffin in the midst of the spot upon which the
horrible Bastille had stood, and upon a great heap of stones
which had formed part of that stronghold; and thus Voltaire,
dead, triumphed over those stones which had gained
a victory over him in life, for Voltaire had been a prisoner
in the Bastille.</p>

<p>On one of the blocks which formed this second altar of
the country they carved this inscription:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_264"></a>[264]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot smcap">

<p>“Receive on this spot, where despotism once fettered
thee, the honors decreed to thee by thy
country.”</p>
</div>

<p>All Paris poured out to walk in the triumphal procession
which accompanied the quiet ashes to their last resting-place.
The car upon which the coffin lay was harnessed by twelve
horses, four abreast, their manes plaited with golden tassels
and beautiful flowers, the reins being held by men dressed
in ancient Greek costume. On the car was a sort of altar
upon which lay a waxen statue of the philosopher crowned
with laurel. This was placed over the remains.</p>

<p>The money spent upon this pageant was immense;
whence it came, no one has ever learnt. It was almost
miraculous. Meanwhile, the people were living upon a
couple of ounces of bread apiece, and a few miserable vegetables.
That passion and vengeance could have been kept
alive upon such reducing diet, is the truest evidence of the
justice of the national cause.</p>

<p>The military formed a portion of the procession, while
cannon boomed incessantly during the march. Finally—and
it is the most significant fact of this remarkable pageant—a
<em>printing-press</em> was made to take part in the procession.
At this press, agile printers were taking off impressions of
sentences in honor of Voltaire, the printed papers being
cast to the seething multitude fresh printed as they were.</p>

<p>Here and there the red cap—the cap of liberty—might
be seen, surmounting the ominous pike.</p>

<p>Every actor and actress in Paris followed, dressed in the
costumes of the characters of Voltaire’s plays. Members of
all the learned bodies followed; a gigantic pyramid was carried
along, bearing the titles of all his works; and, finally,
the statue of the demigod himself—a statue of gold—was
borne upon the shoulders of men dressed in Grecian costume,
this being followed by a casket of gold, containing a
copy of each of his works.</p>

<p>Troops of singing-girls dressed in white met the quiet
cause of all this demonstration, and showered white flowers
upon the catafalque; hymns to his genius were sung, the
air was sick with perfume, and the city trembled with the
roar of adoration.</p>

<p>Night fell before the procession reached the temple dedicated<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_265"></a>[265]</span>
to the remains of great men, and here Voltaire was
enthroned, for he was King of France in that hour; and
the weak, vacillating, and kindly Louis XVI, away there
in the Tuileries, was crownless, awaiting to pay in his person—he
the least odious of his race—for the unceasing
crimes and cruelties of his forefathers.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XLVIII">CHAPTER XLVIII.<br>
<span class="fs70">THE THREAT IS LOUDER.</span></h2>


<p>Throughout August, affairs were tending more and
more to dangerous threats. The National Assembly were
ostensibly framing a new constitution; but the delegates
proceeded very slowly, except in the matter of contradiction,
at which they were very brisk.</p>

<p>The King’s brothers became still further estranged from
him; while the efforts made beyond the frontier, tending to
liberate the royal family from the state of imprisonment in
which they lived, only tended to hasten the growing belief
of the people that by the death of the King, alone could
the nation hope to destroy the chances and the plans of
those Royalists who had escaped from France, and were
blindly endeavoring to serve their own interests by inducing
foreign Courts to declare war against France, and march
upon Paris.</p>

<p>Throughout this period the King gave little expression of
opinion, worked and read incessantly, and bore the threatening
aspect of affairs about him and his family with great
patience. He was an estimable man, honest to a degree,
but stupid, hopelessly prejudiced, and apparently without
any capability of experiencing tenderness or sorrow.</p>

<p>It was now that Roland, the husband of the celebrated
Madame Roland, rose to eminence. Nothing in himself, he
became notorious through his wife—one of the most beautiful,
accomplished, and brilliant, as one of the most unfortunate,
the world has yet seen. Her husband was much
older than herself—cold, deadly, impassive; but, on the other
hand, his steady principles were never for one moment
shaken.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_266"></a>[266]</span></p>

<p>She was a republican, heart and soul; and when the people,
towards the close of the year 1791, began to believe
that the differences between the King and the nation would
be amicably settled, she never swerved one moment in maintaining
that a republic, and only a republic, could save
France from invasion.</p>

<p>General Dumouriez was also rising to power. He was
rather a courtier than a soldier, although he was destined
to win victories: especially amongst women, he was very
successful. He attempted to obtain favor from Madame
Roland herself; but that single-hearted lady, true to her
ice-cold husband, put down the General’s pretensions with
calm contempt. He, however, gained much attention from
Marie Antoinette, as the man who, amongst those who had
acquired the confidence of the people, was the most aristocratic,
and who had, therefore, the most sympathy with the
falling royal cause. The Queen was right. After gaining
several battles for France against the Austrians, he turned
his army upon Paris, intending to intimidate the Republicans.
The army revolted, and Dumouriez himself had to
take refuge in the camp of those very Austrians whom but
a short time previously he had conquered. They would
have nothing to do with him; and, finally, he fled to England,
always open to the refugee, and there he died in obscurity.</p>

<p>This general, therefore, helped to destroy the royal family.
At his first interview with the King, he said, “Sire,
I devote myself wholly to your service. But a minister of
to-day is no longer the minister of yesterday. Without
ceasing to be your Majesty’s devoted servant, I am the
slave of the nation.”</p>

<p>The Queen sent for him privately when he had become
the idol of the people.</p>

<p>“Sir,” said she, “you are all-powerful at this moment;
but it is through popular favor, and that soon destroys its
idols. I tell you I oppose the changes which are being
made in the constitution, so beware!”</p>

<p>“I am confounded,” the General replied; “but I am
more the servant of my country than of your Majesty.
Think of your safety, of the King’s, of that of your children!
You are surrounded by enemies. If, in the King’s
interests, you oppose the new constitution made by the Assembly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_267"></a>[267]</span>
you will endanger the royal family, and in no way
prevent the course of events.”</p>

<p>“Sir,” the Queen frantically replied, “this state of
things cannot last for ever. Beware for <em>yourself</em>.”</p>

<p>“Madame,” said Dumouriez, who <em>had</em> accepted the post
of Premier of the Ministry, and who, at this time, appears
to have very faithfully served the nation—his great fault
was his fickleness,—“madame, when I became Prime Minister,
I knew that my responsibility was not my greatest
danger.”</p>

<p>The Queen shrank back. “Do you think me capable of
having you assassinated?”</p>

<p>Tears were upon the Queen’s face.</p>

<p>“Far be such a fearful thought from me, your Majesty.
Your soul is great and noble, and the bravery you have
shown on many occasions has for ever made me your Majesty’s
most devoted slave.”</p>

<p>The Queen’s anger was appeased in a moment, and she
placed her right hand upon the General’s arm in token of
reconciliation.</p>

<p>Thus it was that this unhappy woman, who had begun
life so extravagantly, while the masses were starving, irritated
the people, and especially all those who had dealings
with her, by the apparent childishness and weakness of her
general character. It was felt that no reliance could be
placed upon her. Born of the great feudal Austrian family
about whom etiquette was so plastered, that only nobles
could sit down in the presence of the royal family, and
then upon a very low stool, she was brought to France at a
very early age, to a Court almost as ridiculous as the one
she had left. But while the Austrians had been excited to
no feelings of hate against their Emperor, Voltaire, Rousseau,
Diderot, had taught the French to look upon royalty
as made up of merciless, greedy puppets; and, unfortunately,
Marie Antoinette—a pure and noble-hearted woman
in herself—had the appearance of totally agreeing with
this description.</p>

<p>While the people were starving, her passion for jewels
became absorbing; while mothers were begging meals for
their little ones, she was taking parts in little comedies at
Versailles.</p>

<p>Her memory can scarcely be blamed. She had never<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_268"></a>[268]</span>
seen the people; and, as a proof that she knew nothing
about them and their wants, we hear about her the celebrated
anecdote, which helped to send her to the scaffold.
Being told the people wanted bread, she replied, “If there
is no bread, why do they not eat cake?”</p>

<p>The people never forgave that—she washed those words
only partly out with her blood. Did she really mean what
she said, or were the words intended for a joke? Did she
really think that if there was no bread there must be
cake; or did she utter that fatal sentence as a witticism?
I venture to think that she was ignorant of the very meaning
of starvation; for courtiers treat kings and queens like
children. A misfortune this, when the people expect them
to be men and women—the condition of things when the
Revolution broke out.</p>

<p>Louis XVI was incapable of managing anything but a
lock; his wife thought she could govern for him, and she
made a sorry mistake.</p>

<p>The King’s grandfather, Louis XV, the preceding King,
had said, “After me, the deluge.” The deluge was upon
the royal family, sweeping around them, and was to overwhelm
the family.</p>

<p>The popular feeling was far stronger against the Queen
than the King.</p>

<p>“See,” she said, one day, before Dumouriez and the
King, and pointing through a window near her; “a prisoner
in this palace, I dare not venture to present myself at a
window that overlooks the garden. But yesterday I wished
to breathe the air, and went to the window. An artilleryman
used the language of a guard-room, and hurled his
words at me; held up his sword, and said he should like to
see my head on it. I have seen them murdering a priest,
and meanwhile, not ten yards away, children and their
nurses are playing at ball. What a country, and what
people!”</p>

<p>That the Queen incessantly conspired to induce a foreign
army to march into France, is very certain.</p>

<p>The King soon mistrusted Dumouriez, who at once offered
to resign his position of Minister. The King at once
accepted, and another friend was lost by royalty.</p>

<p>On taking his leave, Dumouriez foretold what was to
happen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_269"></a>[269]</span></p>

<p>“Sire,” said he, “you think you are about to save religion.
You are destroying it. The priesthood will be
killed; your crown will be taken from you; perhaps even
the Queen and the royal children——”</p>

<p>Dumouriez could not finish the sentence.</p>

<p>“I await—I expect death!” said the King, much
moved; “and I pardon my enemies.”</p>

<p>He turned away, with quivering lips.</p>

<p>Dumouriez never saw Louis XVI again.</p>

<p>He fled from Paris, and especially from La Belle Liègoise,
who, in her blood-colored dress, was now rising to utter
power.</p>

<p>“Build the new parliament,” she cried, “on the site of
the Bastille; and let every woman give her jewels, that
the gold may be coined to pay for the work.”</p>

<p>And taking the golden earrings from her ears, the rings
from her fingers, she cast them before her hearers.</p>

<p>Her power was so great, that during every sudden outbreak
her “nod” condemned any man brought before her,
to death; her “Let him go,” set him at liberty.</p>

<p>She was mad for years before she was placed in the asylum
where she ended her days, twenty years after the death
of the King and Queen. Not a Frenchwoman, but born
at Liège, she had been brought up respectably; she was
even accomplished; but at seventeen she had fallen a
victim to the snares of a young French nobleman.</p>

<p>Thus fallen, she threw herself into all shapes of debauchery;
and when the Revolution broke out, she came
to France, to hunt down and destroy the man who had
destroyed her.</p>

<p>This she did in the raging time to come, of which I have
to tell, and she showed him no mercy.</p>

<p>Neither found she any mercy for herself. The furies of
the Revolution—the <i lang="fr">tricoteuses</i>—seized her, stripped her to
the skin, and whipped her in public, as an obscene prostitute.
This act brought into active force the latent madness
from which she had been suffering for some time. She
was removed to a madhouse, and there she dragged through
twenty years of life. In fierce memory of the indignity
which had been put upon her, she would never put on any
clothing; and so she lived, clutching the bars of her den,
screaming, alternately, “Blood!” and “Liberty!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_270"></a>[270]</span></p>

<p>It took twenty years to enfeeble her constitution, and to
wear her life away into the peacefulness of death.</p>

<p>She was the greatest enemy the Queen had. She declared
Marie Antoinette as frail as herself; for this demon
in woman’s shape insanely gloried in her condition. And
when she gloried in this statement against the “Austrian”—the
most opprobrious name the people could find to cast
at the Queen—her hearers applauded loudly.</p>

<p>So the months drifted on, the events of every day darkening
the fortunes of the royal family.</p>

<p>And now came the time when the palace was besieged.
The King, looking from his window, saw the meeting of a
huge crowd without any alarm: he was, by this time,
accustomed to sudden crowds.</p>

<p>Again a soldier had led the way for the mob. An artillery
officer, instead of obeying orders, and retiring his guns
to defend the palace, pointed to its windows, and cried,
“The enemy is there!”</p>

<p>Two minutes after, the people had got possession of the
Tuileries.</p>

<p>The king—who, whatever his faults, was no coward—rushed
forward towards the massive folding-doors, which
the populace finding bolted, were breaking open.</p>

<p>As he approached, the panels fell at his feet. He ordered
a couple of valets to open these folding-doors.</p>

<p>“What have I to fear,” he said, “from my people?”</p>

<p>A ragged man rushed forward, and thrust a stick, pointed
with iron, at the King. A grenadier of the guard
struck it down with his bayonet. And now the man fell,
whether in a fit or not will always remain a question. Certainly,
as he rushed forward, he was foaming at the mouth.
All that is known farther of him is this—that the mass
pressing forward, he was trampled to death.</p>

<p>For a moment, the power of majesty was once more
asserted.</p>

<p>He had left the Queen, the royal children, and his noble
sister, Madame Elizabeth, in an inner room, and had
ordered the door to be closed after him. This had been
done.</p>

<p>The king now moved to another room, larger, pretending
that there he could speak to a greater number of citizens.
Suddenly, hearing a scuffle, the King turned, to find the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_271"></a>[271]</span>
mob surrounding Madame Elizabeth, who was endeavoring
to reach the King’s side.</p>

<p>“It is the Queen!” screamed several fierce voices. And
they were the voices of women.</p>

<p>In a moment, they turned upon her.</p>

<p>The abhorred Queen was before them, as they thought.
In another moment she would have been killed.</p>

<p>“It is Madame Elizabeth!” cried the soldiers.</p>

<p>The mob fell back with reverence. Even at that point
they could respect Elizabeth, the purity and simplicity of
whose life formed the one favorable point in the united
lives of the royal family, and one to which the whole mass
of the people gave implicit credence.</p>

<p>But she was to die with her family.</p>

<p>“Ah! what have you done?” she cried. “Had they
been allowed to take me for the Queen, and have killed me,
I had perhaps saved the Queen’s life!”</p>

<p>By this time, about twenty of the King’s friends stood
about him, their swords drawn.</p>

<p>“Put up your swords,” said the King; “this multitude’s
more excited than guilty.”</p>

<p>“Where is the Austrian?” now resounded upon all
sides.</p>

<p>The question which excited the multitude was against
the priesthood, whose members, known to favor royalty,
were abhorred by the people. The king had refused to sign
an act by virtue of which the priesthood would have been
annihilated.</p>

<p>A butcher, named Legendre, cried to the King, “The
people are weary of being your plaything and your victim!”</p>

<p>Meanwhile, those who could not gain an entrance to the
besieged palace called loudly to those within, “Are they
dead? Show us, then, their heads!”</p>

<p>“Let him put it on!” cried the butcher, thrusting a
coarse red cap of liberty towards the King on the end of
a pike.</p>

<p>The King smiled, and put the symbol of liberty upon
his head.</p>

<p>“Long live the King!” now cried some voices.</p>

<p>The people now called upon the King to restore Roland—Madame
Roland’s husband—to power, from which he
had been dismissed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_272"></a>[272]</span></p>

<p>The King was inflexible.</p>

<p>“This is not the moment for deliberation,” said the
King.</p>

<p>“Do not be afraid!” whispered a grenadier to Louis.</p>

<p>“My friend,” said the King, “does my heart beat rapidly?”</p>

<p>And he placed the man’s left hand upon his breast.</p>

<p>The pulsation of the King’s heart was perfectly equable.</p>

<p>“If you love the people, drink their health!” cried a
man in rags, pushing forward a common bottle.</p>

<p>The King smiled and took the bottle, saying, “To the
nation!”</p>

<p>And now the cries of “Long live the King!” were so
strong that they floated out upon the crowd waiting to see
the King’s body cast amongst them; and, instead, they
learnt that once more the King had—if only for a time—reconciled
himself to his people.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the Queen was undergoing her agony.</p>

<p>Only the conviction that she was more immeasurable
hated than the King, prevented her from joining him before
the people. She feared her presence might exasperate the
people beyond all control.</p>

<p>She remained in her bed-room, pressing her two children
to her heart.</p>

<p>Suddenly, a beating at the door, and the screams of many
fierce women, upon hearing the words, “The Austrian is
there!”</p>

<p>But they had to call masculine help before they forced
the door.</p>

<p>They found the Queen unprotected, except by her children,
whose presence probably saved their mother from
assassination.</p>

<p>Only a few ladies were with her, one of whom was that
unhappy Princess de Lamballe, who would not remain in
England, who returned to France, and who was one of the
first to fall a victim to the Reign of Terror.</p>

<p>The Queen was found by the screaming crowd of women
standing as I have described, in a bay window, while between
her and the mob, a long, heavy table had been placed
across the window.</p>

<p>By the Queen stood her daughter—near fourteen years
of age.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_273"></a>[273]</span></p>

<p>The Dauphin—then seven years of age, and extremely
handsome—was placed upon the table before her.</p>

<p>The men in the crowd were for the greater part silent;
the women were implacable: one of these thrust forward a
republican red cap, and told the Austrian to put it on Louis’s
head. This she did.</p>

<p>The child took it for a plaything, and smiled.</p>

<p>And now a pretty, rosy, youthful girl came forward, and
using the coarsest possible language, upbraided the Queen
savagely.</p>

<p>“Pray what harm have I done you?”</p>

<p>“Me?—perhaps not. But what harm have you not done
the nation?”</p>

<p>“Poor child!” the Queen replied. “You but repeat
what you have been told. Why should I make the people
miserable? Though not born a Frenchwoman, my children
are French, and I shall never see my native land again.
I was happy when you loved me!”</p>

<p>The girl’s head fell.</p>

<p>“I did not know you,” she said; “and I see now that
you are good!”</p>

<p>And now Santerre—good name for a leader of the people—approached.</p>

<p>“Take the cap off the child!” he cried; “don’t you see
that he is stifling?”</p>

<p>The crowd was tremendous.</p>

<p>And approaching the Queen he whispered, “You have
some awkward friends here. I know of some who would
serve you better.”</p>

<p>This was the first intimation the Queen really had that
there was a party amongst the people actually willing to
raise the royal family they had so utterly degraded.</p>

<p>Five hours that torture lasted before the palace was cleared.
The King and Queen had also been forced to put the
national cockades upon their heads. When once more the
royal house was free, the unhappy people could scarcely find
strength with which to embrace.</p>

<p>Several of the members of the National Assembly wept.</p>

<p>To one, Merlin, the Queen said, “You weep, sir.”</p>

<p>“Yes, madame,” he replied, gravely; “I weep over the
misfortunes of the woman, the wife, and the mother; but,
beyond this, my heart is stone. I hate kings and queens.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_274"></a>[274]</span></p>

<p>These words were the key-stone to French feeling. Louis
XVI and his wife were driven to the block, not as a man
and a wife, as father and mother—but as <em>King</em> and <em>Queen</em>.</p>

<span class="fs70">THE KING QUITS THE TUILERIES.</span></h2>


<p>The National Assembly had ordered the provinces to
send 20,000 troops to Paris. With them they brought the
revolutionary hymn, the “Marseillaise.” It was written
and composed by a young artillery officer, named De Lisle.
It was completed at the piano, after a night’s bout. He
fell asleep over the instrument, and at length awakening,
gradually recalled the air and words of a song, the fierceness
of which sent more French men and women to the block
than did any other motive.</p>

<p>That song drove revolutionary France mad, and took
from the royal family all hope of mercy.</p>

<p>The royal family, however, were still at the Palace of the
Tuileries; and while they remained there, the semblance
of royalty was kept up—albeit, in fact, they were utterly
prisoners.</p>

<p>The Queen, early in August, still utterly relied upon
Lafayette, who did not disguise his desire to retain the
monarchy, under a protectorate—he himself to be the
Protector.</p>

<p>“Mistrust Lafayette,” had said Mirabeau; but the
Queen’s faith was strong, and her confidence hastened
events.</p>

<p>However, one Gaudet, only twenty years of age, was
rising to power amongst the Girondists; and he having intimated
that he felt great interest in the royal family,
matters were so managed that he had an interview with
Marie Antoinette, who, poor lady, took him by the hand,
and led him to the little cot in which her child was sleeping.</p>

<p>“Educate him to liberty, madame,” said the orator. “It
is the one condition of his life.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_275"></a>[275]</span></p>

<p>He kissed the child. Nine months afterwards he was
one of those who sent the King and Queen to the scaffold.</p>

<p>The royal family were now prohibited from shutting a
door, and so much did they dread poison, that they only
pretended to eat of the dishes prepared and set before them,
and really subsisted upon cakes, and other food brought to
them in the pockets of their attendants, who purchased the
eatables at obscure shops.</p>

<p>The Queen made the King wear as a breastplate fifteen-fold
silk; but while the poor man complied, he said, “They
will not assassinate me, but put me to death like a King, in
open daylight.”</p>

<p>He never appears to have thought of the possible execution
of the Queen herself.</p>

<p>“He is no coward,” she said of the King; “but he is
calm in the presence of danger. His courage is in his
heart, only it does not show itself—he is so timid.”</p>

<p>The family now only showed themselves when going to
church on Sunday, and then they were assailed with cries
of “No King!” Louis said it was as though God himself
had turned against him.</p>

<p>One night, a chamber-valet, who slept at the Queen’s
door, was awakened, to find an assassin, dagger in hand,
stealing into the Queen’s room.</p>

<p>Murders now became quite common. One D’Epremesnil,
who had been a great favorite with the people, showed
signs of moderation. Suddenly turned upon by the mob,
he was cut down, dragged through the gutters, and was
about to be thrown into a common sewer, when he was
rescued by a squad of the National Guard. As he lay
dying, Pétion, the Mayor of Paris, looked upon him, and
fainted. Recovering his senses, the victim said to the
Mayor, “And <em>I</em>—I, too, was once the idol of the people!
May you meet with a better fate!”</p>

<p>The sound of the soul-stirring “Marseillaise” had maddened
Paris. The hourly news of the march of the Prussians
upon France fatally intensified that hatred of all who
were favorable to royalty—a hatred which was now about
utterly to burst all bounds.</p>

<p>An almost complete insurrection was adjourned to
August 10.</p>

<p>It was said by the people that Marie Antoinette daily<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_276"></a>[276]</span>
cursed the people; that she had offered a pistol to the King,
and prayed him to destroy himself: that she had vowed,
sooner than leave the royal palace, she would be nailed to
its walls.</p>

<p>In truth, she was battling with her natural royalty—defending
the unemotional King, and endeavoring to take
his place without intruding on his prerogative.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the principal movers in the drama were
being thinned by murder. Mandat, the commandant
general, suspected of treachery rather than of duty, was
shot down before his son’s eyes, and his body was cast into
the Seine.</p>

<p>On the morning of that terrible 10th of August, Madame
Elizabeth, the King’s sister, who had been watching
through the night, listening to the ringing of that bell
which all the Royalists knew was the tocsin of murder,—this
pure-hearted Elizabeth called to the Queen.</p>

<p>“Sister,” she said, “come and see the sun rise.”</p>

<p>And Marie Antoinette looked for the last time upon a
sunrise (it was typically blood-red) which she was to see
through the palace windows.</p>

<p>To Rœderer, the deputy, was due the first suggestion of
that act which was really the King’s abdication—that of
abandoning the royal palace, and asking hospitality of the
Parliament.</p>

<p>“Place yourselves, madame,” he said, “in the care of
the National Assembly. Your persons will then be as
sacred as the constitution.”</p>

<p>The constitution itself was to be a thing of the past in
a few weeks.</p>

<p>At five in the morning, the Queen had her children
dressed and brought to her. The King himself, by his appearance,
should have steeped the guard in confidence. He
should have appeared in uniform. On the contrary, he
appeared in a suit of violet silk—court mourning, in fact,
without boots or spurs, in white silk stockings and pumps;
while his hair presented an absurd spectacle, for it had not
been dressed since the previous day; and while one side
was still rounded and curled, the other was flat and ragged.
He looked about smilingly, but with that vagueness in
which no reliance can be placed. He was simply a good,
stupid, amiable man. He kept apart, all his reign, making<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_277"></a>[277]</span>
locks; he forgot his people, and he was weak enough to
suppose his people would forget him.</p>

<p>As for the Queen she was never more royal.</p>

<p>“Take these!” she said, seizing a couple of pistols and
forcing them into his hands; “and conquer or die with
your friends.”</p>

<p>The King however, handed them to a gentleman by his
side, saying, “No; if I wore arms, the people might be
angry.”</p>

<p>A royal progress was made in the court-yard of the
Tuileries, even in the palace-garden beyond. At first received
with faint applause, the cries of hate soon overwhelmed
the King, and it was with difficulty he gained the
palace alone.</p>

<p>The tocsin had now been calling to arms through many
hours.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Danton, the man of blood, was maddening
the people.</p>

<p>“To arms!” he cried. “Do you not hear the call?”</p>

<p>The infuriated people were now upon the palace.</p>

<p>They attempted once more to burst the doors, while the
artillerymen refused to fire upon the insurgents.</p>

<p>And now the fatal, but inevitable, mistake was made.</p>

<p>“Sire,” cried Rœderer to the King, “time presses. It
is no longer entreaty we use, and only one means is left us.
We ask your permission to use violence towards you; and,
by force, to place you under the safety of the National
Assembly.”</p>

<p>The King still did not wish to leave the palace. He
turned to the Queen.</p>

<p>“Let us go.”</p>

<p>Never again did the royal couple step beneath the roof
of that palace. They left it for a barred prison—that
barred prison for the scaffold.</p>

<p>The King and the royal family were taken to the Assembly,
and put in the reporters’ box, amidst the reporters
themselves.</p>

<p>There were few members present when the King entered
the house, but it soon filled up. The heat was intense, and
the King perspired frightfully. This box was supposed to
be not in the Assembly, because a grating was placed
before it. As the day went on, it was feared the people<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_278"></a>[278]</span>
might break in from behind, and catch the King in this
dungeon. It was, therefore, ordered that the grating should
be removed; and the workers being unskilful, the King’s
knowledge in metal-work prevailing, he came forward, and
helped at its removal; so that in the event of an attack by
the people, whose menaces could be heard, the members of
parliament might shelter the royal family by forming a
living rampart around them.</p>

<p>This agony lasted fourteen hours; but it did not tell
upon the King’s heavy nature. At his usual hour, he was
hungry, asked for food, and he ate a hearty meal as calmly
as though he had passed some hours at lock-making. The
Queen, who suffered dreadfully at the sight of this evidence
of callousness on the part of the King, ate nothing, but
drank a glass or two of iced water with much eagerness.</p>

<p>The people, learning that the King had left the palace,
turned upon this building to destroy it—not to sack it.
The Revolutionists were greedy for blood—not wealth.
“Death to thieves!” was their implacable motto. The
Tuileries were chiefly defended by seven hundred Swiss,
two hundred badly-armed gentlemen, and one hundred
National Guard. At the end of the day, not one-tenth of
them remained alive.</p>

<p>The palace was forced. There stood a Swiss on guard,
many files of comrades behind him. He had orders not to
fire. The people hooked his belt with a pike, dragged him
forward, and disarmed him. Another took his place; he,
also, was disarmed. Five times was this episode repeated.</p>

<p>A shot was fired—some say, by a Swiss; others, by an
insurgent; and this appears to have been the signal.</p>

<p>The people turned upon the five disarmed Swiss, and
beat them to death. One man of huge stature and strength
killed four. The Swiss were now ordered to fire. Many
aimed at the huge man, and he fell with many more. In
a moment, the hall was strewn with the dead and the
dying. From that moment, the Swiss were doomed;
though, for a short time, they were victorious; for the
people were driven back.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the rattle of the musketry echoed through
the building in which the National Assembly were deliberating;
and its cause soon became known.</p>

<p>“Long live the nation!” cried the parliamentarians,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_279"></a>[279]</span>
glaring at the King, who, unhappy man, now helped on
the massacre of his Swiss guards by sending a written
order to their commander to cease firing, whatever happened.
This was really their death-warrant; for fidelity keeping
them near the King’s person, fidelity would compel them
to obey his last command—for this order was the last Louis
XVI ever gave.</p>

<p>Suddenly, shots sounded close at hand. The members
thought it was the Swiss guard, about to fire upon and
massacre the National Assembly. In truth, it was the
National Guard firing upon that division of the Swiss
which had accompanied the King to the National Assembly.</p>

<p>“Now,” cried the President, “is the time to prove ourselves
worthy of the people, and of the position they have
given us, by dying at our posts.”</p>

<p>It was a false alarm; it was royalty dying.</p>

<p>The people now rallied, broke into the palace, and, maddened
by the sight of the dead citizens in the great hall,
charged the Swiss, who were serried on the grand staircase.</p>

<p>Upon those stairs they were driven, leaving comrades
upon every step. The incline afforded good shooting to
the people, who, when they had forced their way to the
top of the stairs, had slain every soldier who had faced
them. The Swiss guard died bravely to the very last man.</p>

<p>After that it was massacre, not fighting. Wherever a
Swiss was found on guard throughout the palace, he was
hacked to pieces. Many were thrown alive from the windows
to the people below. Some few of these solitary
Swiss sentinels showed fight; many threw down their arms,
and either faced death unarmed, or uselessly asked for
mercy.</p>

<p>Seventeen were found kneeling in the palace chapel. In
vain did they show their fire-arms, which, clear and bright,
proved they had not fired upon the people. They were
foreigners; the news came hourly that all Europe was
about to pour upon France, and they were killed before the
very altar.</p>

<p>It is said the people had, to stimulate their bloodthirstiness,
dissolved gunpowder in the wine and brandy they
drank.</p>

<p>Not a Swiss escaped.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_280"></a>[280]</span></p>

<p>The Queen’s women remained trembling in the palace.</p>

<p>One man alone defended their door, and fell—generous
sentinel!</p>

<p>Danton was the very king of the massacre; and publicly
he thanked the people for their day’s work.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, calm, patient, implacable, Robespierre—he
who was to conquer Danton—waited quietly abiding his
time, but always feeling his way.</p>

<p>The Assembly soon learnt the true state of affairs; and,
by their orders, a few Swiss were saved, by being hidden
in the passages and cellars of the House of Assembly.</p>

<p>And now, the Revolutionists, eager for blood, but not for
riches, brought before the National Assembly the spoils of
the Tuileries. Sacks upon sacks of gold, plate, precious
stones, costly ornaments, and even heaps of letters—even
the money found upon the dead Swiss was set out in a separate
pile.</p>

<p>The Girondists now felt that the time was come to abandon
the throne. Vergniaud drew up an act for the <em>provisional
suspension of royalty</em>. This was at once passed.</p>

<p>The King’s fall was signed. A few hours before, he
abandoned his palace. Now, by this Act, the King’s authority
was revoked; payment of money to royalty was
stopped; and the National Assembly declared to hold possession
of the persons of the royal family until happier
times arrived.</p>

<p>This was virtually dethroning the King, and taking him
prisoner.</p>

<p>And how did the King accept this news?</p>

<p>He smiled, and said jocosely, “This is not too constitutional!”</p>

<p>He was the only human being that smiled in that place
upon that fatal day—he whose heart should have felt the
heaviest weight of grief.</p>

<p>But the people around the building shouted for the King’s
life.</p>

<p>The people, however, must not be looked upon harshly.
They had not stolen; and though many hundreds had been
slain by them, they had lost three thousand six hundred
men. The Swiss did not die unavenged.</p>

<p>Then the people went back to their work, tired of bloodshed,
for a few days.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_281"></a>[281]</span></p>

<p>And the royal family were taken to the prison of the
Temple, which three of them quitted only for the scaffold.</p>

<span class="fs70">THE MASSACRES OF SEPTEMBER.</span></h2>


<p>The wretched Queen’s head and eyelids drooped for a
moment as she heard the words which dethroned her husband;
then, once again, her head was high and defiant.
Together with the misfortune of the Austrian Hapsburg,
she inherited their pride and courage. From that hour to
the moment of her death, her courage never failed her. She
appears to have equally forgiven and despised.</p>

<p>Events now followed with terrible rapidity. The Prussians
entered France and the town of Verdun fell into their
power. That humiliation brought about the massacres of
September. The town council purposed their capitulation.
Then Colonel Beaupaire, the commandant, opposed it; and
refusing to sign the capitulation, he blew out his brains at
the council. His body was removed, the capitulation signed,
the Prussians marched in, and the daughters of the
principal inhabitants, strewed flowers before the foreign
troops.</p>

<p>All of those girls—to be excused, by reason of their
youth—were, during the Reign of Terror, sent to the guillotine.</p>

<p>Beaupaire’s body was carried away by his men, who
marched out of Verdun with all the honors of war, and to
it was accorded a state funeral, while the heart was placed
in the Pantheon.</p>

<p>Every day, Danton was rising into power.</p>

<p>Every day, Robespierre was following him, and marking
him down with the vigor of a sleuth hound.</p>

<p>It was he who organised the September massacres. On
the 28th of August, a grave-digger, who knew the plan of
certain catacombs, was awakened at six in the morning by
a Government agent, and told to prepare this place, within
ten days, for receiving a large number of bodies. He was
ordered to be silent, on pain of death.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_282"></a>[282]</span></p>

<p>On this same day, organised bands of fierce-looking men,
springing no one knew whence, patrolled the streets. The
gates of Paris were closed, so that no one could escape,
though thousands had fled between the day of the King’s
first fall and this one, the 28th of August.</p>

<p>Every house was visited. Five thousand persons, suspected
of leaning towards royalty, were seized during the following
night. Every court-house, convent, prison, was overflowing
with prisoners.</p>

<p>Robespierre still remained quiet and watchful—still lived
in hiding in the house of good Duplay, the joiner.</p>

<p>On that night, Robespierre went to the apartments of St.
Just, in the Rue St. Anne, and found him calmly going to
bed.</p>

<p>“Why not?” asked St. Just. “Murder will be done to-night,
but I cannot prevent it. And again, those who will
die are our enemies. Good night.”</p>

<p>He fell asleep. Awaking, hours after, he marked Robespierre,
pale, haggard.</p>

<p>“Have you returned?”</p>

<p>“<em>Returned!</em>”</p>

<p>“What! have you not slept?”</p>

<p>“Slept!” cried Robespierre; “when the blood of thousands
is being shed by hundreds of assassins—when pure or
impure blood runs down the streets like water! Oh, no,”
he continued, with a sardonic smile; “I have not slept—I
have watched, like remorse or crime; I have had the weakness
not to close my eyes. But <em>Danton—he has slept</em>!”</p>

<p>On Sunday (of all days in the week), it being the 2nd of
September, at three in the afternoon, the signal for the
massacre was given, by one of those strange accidents with
which we are all acquainted. Five coaches, filled with prisoners,
were passing. These prisoners happened, by chance,
to be all priests.</p>

<p>“See the friends of the Prussians!” cried one in the
crowd. It was enough. The rage of knowing that the
Prussians had conquered Verdun made them mad in a moment.</p>

<p>From that hour until four days were passed, murder was
unceasing all over Paris. It was enough to look like a
Royalist, and death followed.</p>

<p>Half the priests were killed in the carriages, before
they reached the prison gates.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_283"></a>[283]</span></p>

<p>Inside those gates, as inside the gates of all the other
ordinary or improvised prisons, sat the revolutionary tribunes,
twelve fierce men, who decided rapidly the fate of the
prisoner, while they drank and smoked.</p>

<p>They were chiefly in shirt-sleeves. However, here and
there might be seen white-handed men, who evidently were
the master spirits of those terrible juries, which, in their
way, were merciful, for they did not condemn a prisoner to
death. If acquitted, the decree was “Set this gentleman
at liberty;” if guilty, “To the Force,”—a decree which
was a pun, for there was a prison called La Force, while the
word “force” may be said to be “death;” therefore, “à la
force” conveyed to the prisoner the idea that he was to be
conveyed to the prison of La Force. In this belief, when
approaching the prison gate, he had no idea death was at
hand. The gate opened, and he was delivered to the force
of an organised band, who quickly despatched him. Each
band of executioners was controlled by a hidden chief.
They moved from prison to prison as the revolutionary juries
sat, and they did their work with the steadiness of actual
business.</p>

<p>The prison massacres began with the Swiss, at the
Abbaye. They knew what was coming. They were one
hundred and fifty. A young officer led the way. He was
very young and beautiful, and the murderers fell back.
He folded his arms. The bayonets came nearer. He
rushed forward, grasped five or six of the bayonets in his
arms, and fell upon their points.</p>

<p>They all died—their commander, one Major Redding
being the last. He said he would see his men out. There
were not enough wagons to carry the bodies to the catacombs,
so they were heaped up until the return of the tumbrils.</p>

<p>Benches were set for women to see these massacres, and
they and their children danced round the dead bodies.</p>

<p>At the “Abbey” prison the prisoners were shot down
in the chapel, and while two priests, eighty and white-haired,
were preparing them for death.</p>

<p>Some anticipated execution by suicide.</p>

<p>One Sombreuil, a prisoner, was condemned to death, and
he was loosed to the mob. Bayonets were at his breast,
when his daughter, who was waiting in the midst of the
murderers, flung herself before him and asked for his life.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_284"></a>[284]</span></p>

<p>The crowd accorded it upon one condition—that she
should drink a glass of blood, then flowing from one of the
dying.</p>

<p>This she did, and saved him.</p>

<p>Another father and daughter, the Cazottes, left the
prison together—he condemned, she free. But the daughter
cried that she would die with him. So they spared both
lives. So far, the national madness had not destroyed pity
for women.</p>

<p>The King’s first gentleman, one Thierri, being pierced
by a pike, cried, “God save the King!” and died, waving
his hat as he was transfixed to the woodwork to which he
clung.</p>

<p>A deputy of the National Assembly came to one of the
prisons, to claim two prisoners; whom obtaining, as he
passed from the prison, the murderers, eating as they sat
on the bodies of their victims, asked him, “Are you tired
of life?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Then see the heart of an aristocrat!”</p>

<p>The speaker tore the heart from the gaping breast of the
dead man upon which he was coolly seated.</p>

<p>Yet these murderers refused all recompense. The first
bands were men of comparative education; but, not being
bred butchers, they soon sickened at the task, and left it to
be continued by men of more iron nerves than theirs.</p>

<p>Blood had by this time, drenched nine prisons. From
one alone, the tumbrils had removed one hundred and
ninety bodies.</p>

<p>Sixty assassins; this was the number to be seen at each
prison door, waiting for the blood of the aristocrats.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, one hundred and sixty heads fell upon the
scaffold, some being those of women. The poor Princess
de Lamballe, the Queen’s devoted friend, was not one of
those saved. She had followed the royal family to the
Temple prison, but she was torn from them after a few
days. She was a very young widow, passionately loved by
her father-in-law, who lived far away in the country. He
forwarded 12,000<i>l.</i> to save her life, if possible. It was her
want of courage, or, perhaps, ability to dissemble, which
cost this poor lady her life. On September 3rd, she appeared
before the tribunal. She had passed two days continually<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_285"></a>[285]</span>
fainting; and when ordered, with feigned brutality,
by two National Guards to follow them, she asked permission
to die where she was. One of them leant down, and
whispered, “It is to save you.”</p>

<p>Upon coming before the tribunal, the sight of the blood
all about deprived her of consciousness. It was long before
she comprehended what was required of her.</p>

<p>“Swear the love of liberty and equality, and hatred of
kings!”</p>

<p>“I swear the first,” she said, “but not the second. It
is not in my heart.”</p>

<p>One of the judges whispered to her—“Swear everything,
or you are lost.”</p>

<p>She remained silent.</p>

<p>“Well—when you go out, cry ‘Long live the nation!’”</p>

<p>She nodded; but upon being led out by two men, one of
them a leader in the massacres—one Grand Nicholas,—upon
sight of the dead bodies, she cried, “Good God! how
horrible!”</p>

<p>Nicholas put his hand over her mouth. They had traversed
half the street in safety, when a drunken barber, trying
to strike off her cap with his knife, wounded her in the
forehead. The men about believed her condemned, and in
a few moments she was dead, her head cut off, and set
amongst the glasses on the counter of a wine-shop, where
they drank to her death. The barber then set the head
upon a pole, and carried it in procession to the Temple.
There the crowd forced an entrance, and insisted upon
shewing the head to the ex-Queen.</p>

<p>The King was called upon to show himself to the people;
and though an unknown friend endeavored to prevent Louis
from seeing the head, the kind intention was foiled, and
the King recognised the features. Marie Antoinette was
now demanded, and she presented herself to the people;
but the King, active for once, saved his wife from the sight
of poor Lamballe’s head. She only learnt what had happened
in the evening.</p>

<p>Three days’ murders! At two other prisons, five hundred
and seventy-five victims awaited burial. At the end
of the three days, the murder of women was common. A
beautiful girl, one of the people, having wounded her lover
from jealousy, and he being a national soldier, she was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_286"></a>[286]</span>
burnt alive, under circumstances of peculiar atrocity, suggested
by the wretched woman, “La Belle Heleise,” whose
advancing madness was her excuse. Her own time, when
she was to be lashed by her own sex, was fast approaching.</p>

<p>A negro—a huge giant—was especially famous during
these three days. He, it is said, killed over two hundred.
He gave himself no rest; stopped only to drink wine,
and, naked to the waist, was a fearful sight, seen, as he
habitually was, with the fair head of a slain woman swinging
in his left hand. At last, he himself was slain, but
not for two years, during which, where blood flowed, he was
ever to be seen. At the end, he said he had revenged himself,
not upon the enemies of France, but upon the enemies
of his race—<em>the whites</em>.</p>

<p>It is said ten thousand fell in those three days and
nights.</p>

<p>The murderers began at last to turn upon one another.
Especially was this the case with the bands who adopted
death by burning.</p>

<p>A weaver—one Laurent—drew up a list of those it was
intended to kill, and placed upon it the name of a tradesman,
who refused to give him credit. The tradesman,
having a friend in a member of the National Assembly,
threw himself upon his protection. The name was erased,
and Laurent’s written above it; and when Laurent pointed
to the tradesman at the place of execution, he was himself
seized, and cast into the flames.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the Prussians on the frontier were preparing
to advance.</p>

<p>This threat of invasion gave the public sentiment an impetus
towards panic, which there was no resisting.</p>

<p>The National Assembly, which was composed, for the
greater part, of men of ripe age, was practically abolished
by the constitution of a “Convocation,” in which the majority
of the men of power were under thirty, while
amongst them, several were scarcely more than of age.</p>

<p>The King, once in prison, it has been seen how the fact
was followed by the fearful massacres of September 2nd,
3rd, and 4th. Scarcely were they complete, than the men
in power began to protest against their enormity, and it
was endeavored to be shown, with some success, that these
wholesale murders were perpetrated by a fierce organization<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_287"></a>[287]</span>
of but comparatively few men, who cast this great shame
upon France.</p>

<p>Certainly, the same men were at the doors of the various
prisons, while the rough order established amongst them,
far more clearly pointed to the operation of a secret society,
than to the sudden unorganized rage of a maddened people.</p>

<p>The Convention was really divided into Girondists and
Jacobins—the former led by Roland and Vergniaud, their
party being distinguished by moderation; the latter, led by
Robespierre (now rapidly becoming the leading man in the
Revolution), Danton, and the miserable savage, Marat,
who even condescended to attract the approbation of the
lowest rabble, by wearing rags, as clothes, offensive from
very want of cleanliness—a shape of vanity fortunately
rarely to be found.</p>

<p>The life or death of the King was really the question of
the Convention; it was the test of Royalty or Republicanism,
and no man knew this better than Robespierre. It
was by the exercise of this knowledge that he rose to
power—to that power, by the exercise of which almost all
the men who had formed a portion of the National Assembly,
who were members of the Convention which superseded
the Assembly, were sent to the scaffold before he
himself mounted the fatal ladder.</p>

<p>It was evident how things lay when the question of
lodging the President of the Convention was mooted. It
being proposed that he should lodge in the Tuileries, then
called the National Palace, Tallien cried, “Why, out of
this chamber, your President is but a plain citizen; therefore,
if he is wanted, let him be sought for in the garrets
where, in general, only truth and virtue are to be found.”</p>

<p>Danton and Robespierre were now mortal, although concealed,
enemies. They knew that one must destroy the
other—which?</p>

<p>The theory of a republic was now declared; it was the
first step to the beheading of the King, to whom I will now
return.</p>

<p>The Temple, to which the royal family had been taken,
was an old building, half monastery, half castle, which had
once been one of the strong-holds of those monk-soldiers,
the Knights Templars. It was composed of a couple of
towers, one seventy feet high, the other much smaller, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_288"></a>[288]</span>
a large space of ground, surrounded by a comparatively low
wall. This enclosure contained many houses, and especially
a very fine building, once the palace of the Templars
themselves. Many of the windows of the surrounding
houses, which formed part of the lowest quarter of Paris,
overlooked these grounds, in which there was an avenue of
chestnut trees, and a pretty garden.</p>

<p>The towers had not been used for almost hundreds of
years, and the contents of their several floors were of the
most wretched description. The rooms themselves, built
round a central staircase, were desolate in the extreme;
while the walls being nine feet deep, the windows loopholes,
and even these barred, it need not be said that the interior
was never wholesomely light.</p>

<p>The royal prisoners were taken to the old palatial building
upon their arrival, and the poor King at once expressed
a sense of relief at the serenity his wife and children now
enjoyed, compared with the dangers they ran at the royal
palace.</p>

<p>The family supped together, and the King, as usual, ate
heartily. The municipals told off to watch the prisoners,
stood during the meal, but this slight semblance of respect
was soon to disappear.</p>

<p>Louis chatted cheerfully as to what their life should be—how
he would be his son’s school-master—how the garden
was large enough for exercise—how they should live, and
employ the day. He even inspected the rooms, the beds,
the linen; in a word, was once more the man he had
always been—a rather quiet spirited, inquisitive, active,
dull man.</p>

<p>But this respite lasted only during a few hours. The
King had appointed the various bed-rooms, but before the
Dauphin could be put to bed in the one set down as his, an
order came from the authorities, ordering that the royal
family should be lodged in the smaller tower.</p>

<p>They waited until after midnight before their new place
of imprisonment was ready, and then themselves carried
what was wanting to the tower. The King’s servant asking
where his master was to be lodged, the municipal officer
replied, “Your master has been living under gilded
roofs; he will find none here, and learn at the same time
how we lodge the murderers of the people.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_289"></a>[289]</span></p>

<p>Madame Elizabeth was lodged in the kitchen, on the
ground floor; the so-called Court on the second; the King,
Queen, and children, on the floors above. The walls and
the floors were bare, except for some obscene pictures on
the walls, which the King took down, turning them to the
wall.</p>

<p>The King went to bed, and fell asleep. Not so the
Queen, who remained awake the whole night.</p>

<p>The next day, adapting himself to even these fallen circumstances,
the King ordered the day’s plans; and pushing
about the room, came upon a small collection of books,
chiefly Latin—a discovery which once more brought a smile
of pleasure to his face.</p>

<p>Ten days afterwards, 20th August, and when the royal
family had retired for the night, the noise of many advancing
feet awakened them. The authorities of the prison
came armed with orders from Parliament, to deprive the
royal family of every attendant who had hitherto followed
their fortunes. The agony the Queen experienced upon
parting with the Princess de Lamballe was intense.</p>

<p>“From this night,” cried Marie Antoinette, “I do date
my captivity.”</p>

<p>Within a fortnight, as I have related, the poor Princess
de Lamballe’s head was raised on a pike to the window of
the Queen’s prison. One Tison’s wife was appointed to
look after the Queen; while Simon, afterwards celebrated
for his cruelty to the Dauphin, and Rocher, a mere brute,
were the gaolers-in-chief.</p>

<p>It was Rocher who never passed by the Queen without
blowing clouds of tobacco-smoke in her Majesty’s face.</p>

<p>The walls of the Temple were ablaze with comments
upon the royal family. Here might be read an attack upon
Louis’s stoutness, there a savage comment upon the Queen.
Even the children were not spared. For instance, this sentence
was scrawled upon the walls: “What are King’s
children? Whelps who ought to be strangled before they
are old enough to devour the people.”</p>

<p>The unfortunate captives at last dreaded to take the air;
the guard saluted whenever a municipal passed by, but they
reversed arms as the King went by.</p>

<p>At last, they limited the number of steps the royal family
might take when exercising.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_290"></a>[290]</span></p>

<p>The upper windows of the house overlooking the prison
were now the only consolation left to the unhappy royal
captives. But that comprehensive freemasonry of misery
with which we are all somewhat acquainted, the friends of
the fallen family, who were still at liberty, took the upper
rooms, from which they could see their King and his family.
The captives soon learnt, by almost indescribable
signs, the windows which were friendly to them. This one
would show a white flower; from another, a hand would be
waved; and now and again a placard would be raised for a
moment.</p>

<p>On the 24th of September, the King, having fallen
asleep after dinner, was aroused by a great tumult in the
street, below his window.</p>

<p>It was the people declaring the abolition of royalty, and
the declaration of a republic.</p>

<p>“My kingdom,” he said to the Queen, “has passed
away like a dream, and it has not been a happy dream.
God gave it me, and the people take it away. I pray that
France may be happy.”</p>

<p>On the evening of the same day, one of his gaolers
asked the King brutally, if he knew that he was living in
a republic.</p>

<p>“I have heard it,” he replied; “and I have prayed that
the republic may deal justly with my country. I have
never placed myself between the people and their happiness.”</p>

<p>So far, the King had been allowed to wear his sword and
his heraldic orders.</p>

<p>“You must know,” said his gaoler, “that the republic
has suppressed these baubles; so take them off. You are
now but a citizen, as we are, and must be as we are; yet,
what you want, ask the republic for, and you shall not be
denied.”</p>

<p>“I thank you,” said the King calmly. “I want for nothing.”</p>

<p>Very calmly, he continued his interrupted reading.</p>

<p>Amongst the books he read at this time were “The Life
and death of Charles I, of England,” and the “Decline and
Fall of the Roman Empire.”</p>

<p>The Convention, however, had not behaved illiberally to
the captives. The members assigned twenty thousand<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_291"></a>[291]</span>
pounds to their use; but very little was really expended in
the direction it was intended to go. The royal family were
wretchedly off for clothes. They had borrowed here and
there; and the Queen herself employed many hours daily
in mending and patching the clothes of the family, which
had been much torn during the day which ended in the
imprisonment of Louis and his family in the Temple.</p>

<p>The English ambassador, in fact, was the chief donor of
the clothes which enabled the royal family to be the possessors
of a mere change of linen.</p>

<p>It is said that the wretched gaolers vied with each other
in making the fallen captives shed tears. That man who
succeeded was envied by his comrades. Well has it been
said that the success of a revolution which was the result of
generations of misgovernment, had fallen heavily upon those
royal personages who had least helped to produce the national
hate of royalty, while that victory had of itself driven
the vanquishing people into madness.</p>

<p>But the last degradations had not been put upon the
Bourbons. Soon there came an order from the Convention,
to the effect that the King was to be utterly separated from
his family.</p>

<p>They were now to be debarred that last consolation of
the unfortunate—to suffer together.</p>

<p>The despair which ensued even moved the wretch, Rocher.
But the order was imperative, and that night the King
was removed from the small tower, and was imprisoned in
the larger. He was now quite alone.</p>

<p>This occurred before the termination of September; and,
as though to make the desolation still more complete, the
whole family were utterly deprived of the means of writing,
even to each other. Not a scrap of paper was allowed—not
a pencil—not even a fragment of chalk.</p>

<p>The great tower was being repaired. All the accommodation
offered to Louis was a bed and a chair, set in heaps
of brick and plaster rubbish, which overspread the floor.</p>

<p>Poor man! nature compelled him to be active; and,
therefore, being deprived of reading and writing materials,
he passed this first excruciating night of his acutest misery
in counting the steps of the sentinel as he passed up and
down in the corridor outside the King’s cell.</p>

<p>This night, the King, for the first time, shed tears. His<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_292"></a>[292]</span>
only companion was a valet, named Cléry, who had been
appointed by the municipal authorities when the King’s
servants were removed. He was a Revolutionist; but his
heart was in the right place.</p>

<p>The one fragment of hope to which the king clung on
this wretched night was the suggestion made by this valet,
that as he had, since his appointment, dressed daily the
hair of the ladies of the family, that he should be able to
carry messages between them and the King.</p>

<p>Daylight dispelled this hope. It was intimated that
Cléry was not to leave the tower—that the isolation of the
King from all exterior communication must be complete.</p>

<p>When the man made application to this effect, the
answer he scoffingly received was, “Your master will never
see even his children again.”</p>

<p>“’Tis an outrage upon nature!” urged the King, when
he was visited by the authorities. “You murder five
hearts in one—you do that, indeed, which is worse than
murder!”</p>

<p>The authorities turned their backs upon the King, not
deigning to answer him.</p>

<p>All that was brought him as food on that first morning
of the separation from his family, was a piece of bread, and
a pot of water, into which a lemon had been squeezed.</p>

<p>“They have forgotten we are two,” said the King, advancing
to Cléry, and breaking the bit of bread in half;
“but I do not forget. Take this; the remainder is enough
for me.”</p>

<p>The servant refused, but the King insisted; and so the
valet took it, and wept as he ate. The King also wept.
What a picture to contemplate!—a king and a valet eating
a fragment of bread between them, and tears falling
upon the wretched meal!</p>

<p>The King again asked for news of his family, and a reply
not forthcoming, he entreated that he might have some
books given him to drive away the hours.</p>

<p>The Queen had passed the night in a series of fainting-fits;
but, even at that pass, that far higher spirit than the
King’s, which had begotten her so much of the popular
hate, still supported her. The King, though weeping, could
eat half the morsel of bread—she resolutely refused to
touch food.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_293"></a>[293]</span></p>

<p>This determination startled the municipals. They were
answerable to the Convention for the prisoners. What if
the Queen should starve herself to death?</p>

<p>“Well, they shall dine together to-day,” said a municipal
officer; “and to-morrow the Commune must decide.”</p>

<p>The Queen, holding her children in her arms, flung herself
upon her knees, and began rapidly praying—so also did
Elizabeth.</p>

<p>“I believe,” said the brutal Simon, “that these confounded
women are even making <em>me</em> weep! Bah!” he
added, turning to the Queen; “you did not let tears fall
when you caused the people to be assassinated, on the 10th
of August!”</p>

<p>“I never harmed a human being,” said the Queen.</p>

<p>The Commune decreed that the family should take their
meals together. The members knew somewhat of Marie
Antoinette’s determination, and they found that, if separated
from her husband, she really would die from inanition,
it has to be recorded that the reunion of the King and
Queen, during the last four months of their lives, was due,
not to the pity, but the fear, of their gaolers.</p>

<p>But they only met at meals, and then they were compelled
to speak French only, and in a loud voice. The
children were never again allowed play about their father.
This family was killed by inches. Their hearts were dead
before the knife of the guillotine mercifully released them.</p>

<p>Cléry took pity upon them, and, at the risk of his own
liberty and life, forwarded, by his wife, who was allowed to
come and see him once a week, a line of farewell to this or
that friend, from the King and Queen. These adieux,
some of which still exist, are written with the stump of a
pencil, upon the margins of printed pages, and which were
torn from books.</p>

<p>The King’s cell was, in a few days, set in something like
order; but, with a refinement of cruelty beyond description,
the walls were hung with a paper representing the interior
life of prisons.</p>

<p>Now quite desolate, this is how the King spent his time.
He rose at daybreak, and, kneeling, prayed for a long
time. Then, the light quickening, he went to the window,
and read the psalms for the day. After this, the King read
what books he could obtain—he read many scores during<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_294"></a>[294]</span>
his captivity—and this reading appeared entirely to occupy
his mind. At nine, the family met, when he kissed them
all on the forehead. After breakfast, he taught his son in
various branches of knowledge. The Dauphin, precocious
in misery, had by this time tested the dispositions of most
of the sentinels; and when one he knew to be less brutal
than the majority mounted guard, the poor child ran with
the news to his mother, and he was happy for the day.</p>

<p>At two, the family again met, and dined. But the King
dared not give way to the fine appetite which never deserted
him at any period of his life, for he knew not only that
the quantity of food he ate was recorded, and the amount
spread over Paris, but that the Queen herself was exceedingly
desirous that this weak point in the King’s prison-life
should not give cause to enable it to be said that the
King’s appetite in prison was so great that necessarily he
must be hardened and callous to a degree.</p>

<p>After dinner, the King and Queen were allowed to
remain for a brief time together—nay, they were allowed a
pack of cards and a set of chessmen; but they were forbidden
to speak in a low tone to each other, and a sentinel
always kept the unhappy couple within view.</p>

<p>At four, the King generally fell asleep, when the family
remained religiously silent.</p>

<p>At six, the lessons were re-commenced with the Dauphin,
and these went on until supper-time, when the Queen herself
undressed the Dauphin, who said, in a low tone, the
following prayer: “Almighty God, who has created and
redeemed me, I love you. Watch the days of my father
and my family, and save us from our enemies, and give my
mamma, and my aunt, and sister strength to bear all their
trouble.”</p>

<p>The Dauphin put to bed, the Queen read aloud to the
King, her daughter, and Madame Elizabeth.</p>

<p>At nine, the king was conducted back to his prison,
where he read until midnight, when he went to bed, and
slept until daybreak. He, however, did not retire until he
had learnt who was master of the guard for the following
day. If the name was one associated with kindness, the
King’s heart was light, and he fell asleep with utter
serenity.</p>

<p>The prison was very damp, and, after a time, the King<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_295"></a>[295]</span>
fell ill. Cléry watched him, and himself fell ill as Louis
became convalescent. This valet, long after all was over,
recounted some beautiful particulars of this illness.</p>

<p>The Dauphin would nurse him, and passed day after day
in the man’s sick-room; while the King himself would
often come in the night, bare-footed, and merely in his
night-dress, to see how the valet was progressing, or to give
him medicine.</p>

<p>It being ordered that more bolts should be placed upon
the doors of the tower in which the King was imprisoned,
the mason employed to sink the holes in the stone-work
into which the bolts were to run, going to a meal, and
leaving his work tools upon the ground, the King took up
a chisel, and began laboring at the means taken to
strengthen his prison. The mason recognised the King at
this labor.</p>

<p>“Ah,” said he “when you leave this place, you will be
able to say you worked at your own prison.”</p>

<p>“And how shall I leave it?” asked the King, who suddenly
drew his son towards him, and retired to his cell,
where he paced up and down a long while.</p>

<p>The watch was intense. Every loaf of bread sent to the
royal table was searched and broken, the fruit—the very
kernel of a peach, upon one occasion split to find a letter.</p>

<p>A deputation arriving, asked the King whether he lacked
anything.</p>

<p>“Yes,” he said; “my wife and family want clothes—you
see we are in rags.”</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the King’s cousin, the Duke of Orleans, who
had become a Republican under the name of Citizen Philip
Equality, uttered no word in favor of his royal cousin languishing
in the Temple.</p>

<p>Another misfortune now fell upon the King. It will be
remembered how fond the King was of lock-making. His
master in the art, one Gamain, had loved the King dearly,
but he turned upon the fallen monarch. It appears that
prior to quitting the Tuileries, the King, being desirous of
hiding certain treasures, and especially certain papers
received from abroad, relative to the schemes in progress
for helping the King by the invasion of France, he had
worked with this blacksmith at the formation of a hiding-place
in the walls of the palace for the iron box, which contained
these papers and valuables.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_296"></a>[296]</span></p>

<p>After the arrest of the King, Gamain fell ill of a slow
consuming illness, probably low fever, when gradually he
convinced himself that a certain glass of water the King
had himself handed the locksmith, while they were both
putting the finishing strokes to the hiding-place, was poisoned,
and that the King’s motive was a conviction that
the secret of these State papers could only be safe through
his, the blacksmith’s, death. This man must surely have
been overpowered by delirium when such a conviction took
possession of him. His illness continuing, the thought of
revenge took possession of him; and finally, he denounced
the whole affair to the Convention.</p>

<p>This act did more to send the King to the scaffold than
any other process executed against Louis XVI. In the
first place, the theory of the poison was at once accepted,
and it appeared necessarily very feasible to a multitude
ignorant of the question of poisons; and, in the second, no
proof could be brought against Louis of conspiring with a
foreign Power to invade France; an act which was treason—therefore
one which, proved, called for the penalty of
death.</p>

<p>Gamain led the way to the spot where lay concealed the
hidden treasure, and upon papers found in that box Louis
XVI was put upon his trial.</p>

<p>The King became accustomed to captivity—found it
almost rest—rest which was disturbed only on December 11
(1792), when the noise of an approaching procession drew
the attention of the royal family to their windows.</p>

<p>The King learnt that he was to be put upon his trial.
Two hours afterwards, he was on his way to the Convention.</p>

<p>To him, the city appeared as though besieged. Every
soldier around the royal carriage had had served out to him
sixteen cartridges.</p>

<p>The King looked wretched. His razors had been taken
from him, and his hair was rough and scrubby about his
face. He had grown thin, and his clothes hung miserably
about him. But he was quite unmoved.</p>

<p>He took his seat quietly before the Convention.</p>

<p>“Citizens,” cried the President, “Louis Capet is at the
bar. You are about to give a lesson to kings.”</p>

<p>The accusation was then read. It accused him of high
treason in calling upon the foreigner to enter France.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_297"></a>[297]</span></p>

<p>He listened quite unmovedly until he was accused of
“shedding the blood of the people.” He raised his eyes to
heaven. It was clear he had not anticipated being called a
sanguinary prince.</p>

<p>At the close of the first day’s examination, the King’s
fatal appetite failed him, and he refused an offer to obtain
refreshments; but almost immediately afterwards, seeing a
soldier gnawing a piece of bread, he asked for a part, and
ate it with relish.</p>

<p>Upon the return-ride to the Temple, he counted the
number of streets.</p>

<p>It was the King’s sister, Elizabeth—a veritable angel,—who
foresaw what was to happen.</p>

<p>“Was the Queen mentioned in the indictment?” she
asked.</p>

<p>“No,” replied the King.</p>

<p>“Thank heaven!” said the good Princess; “for if the
Queen were taken, who, then, should look after these
children?”</p>

<p>These very words foretell what the Princess foresaw—that
if the Queen’s blood was demanded, her own would
follow.</p>

<span class="fs70">THE KING’S TRIAL PROCEEDED WITH.</span></h2>


<p>The King had scarcely quitted the Convention upon the
occasion of his first appearance there, than he was accorded
the privilege of even the commonest prisoner on his trial—that
of choosing two counsel for his defence. The King
chose two—one named Trouchet; the other, Target. The
former willingly accepted the office; the second dreaded to
appear as the accomplice of the King; and wrote a cowardly
letter, saying, to defend Louis Capet would be to outrage
his own principles. But this precaution, so far from
saving him, marked him out to the terrorists as a man who
was a coward, and, in his turn, he was drafted to the scaffold,
undefended and unlamented.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_298"></a>[298]</span></p>

<p>An old man, and a great one, of a family notorious for
their wisdom and their justice—one Malsherbes, aged
seventy-four, and who had served twice as a Minister during
Louis XVI’s reign—took the position offered to the
wretched man, Target, and refused by him.</p>

<p>Indeed, he asked for it. The act is well worth admiration.
At seventy-four, when most men are weary of life,
this good man asked for a position which he knew was one
which might involve the forfeiture of his own existence.
Said he, “I was twice summoned to the council of him
who was my master at a time when everybody was ambitious
of the post, and I owe him this service now that this
office is, in the eyes of most persons, one of danger; and
had I the means of acquainting him with my wishes, I
should not seek another mode of striving to serve him” (he
was speaking to the President of the Convention); “but I
think, seeing the position you hold, that you can most
safely convey to Louis XVI my desire to serve him.”</p>

<p>The Convention, violent as were its members, reverenced
this devotion of friendship, and honest Malsherbes was
appointed to the task of defending the fallen King.</p>

<p>“Malsherbes,” said a friend to him, as he was leaving
the Convention, “you are the friend of Louis XVI; how
can you bring him papers in which he will read the expressions
of the wrath of the people against him?”</p>

<p>“The King is not like other men,” returned M. de Malsherbes.
“He possesses a great mind, and such faith as
raises him above all things.”</p>

<p>“You are an honest man,” replied the friend. “But if
you were not, what is to prevent you from bringing him
poison, as a weapon, or advising him to commit suicide?”</p>

<p>Malsherbes hesitated for a moment, and then he replied,
“If the King were of the religion of the philosophers—were
he a Cato or a Brutus—he might kill himself. But
he is pious—he is a Christian—he knows that religion forbids
him to lay violent hands upon himself, and he will not
commit suicide.”</p>

<p>Malsherbes went daily after this to see the King, to commune
with him upon the defence which was to be set up.</p>

<p>But of what avail was any defence? The question was
not whether or not the King was guilty, but whether or
not his death would be of advantage to the establishment
of the republic.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_299"></a>[299]</span></p>

<p>During these final days of his life, the King was entirely
deprived of the consolation of seeing his family. He was
now kept completely isolated. However, by the mercy of
Cléry, his servant, on the one hand, and that of Turgy, the
Queen’s attendant, on the other, the desolate couple communicated.
A few words were written on a morsel of thin
paper, which, being folded, a needle was run through it, and
it was in this condition concealed in a hank of sewing-thread,
which was put in the Queen’s work-box by Turgy,
who placed the thread, and its answering line, in Cléry’s
way, who conveyed it to a place where the King would look
for it.</p>

<p>Louis XVI never had any doubt that he would be executed.
On the other hand, he does not appear, up to the
time of his trial, to have assumed for one moment that the
Queen would suffer.</p>

<p>Before his sentence was pronounced, he made his will.
It is a long document. Here are some of the chief lines in
this testament:—“I, Louis XVI of that name, and King
of France, confined for four months in the Tower of the
Temple, at Paris, by those who were my subjects, and deprived
during eleven days of all communication with even
my family, and, moreover, implicated in a trial, the outcome
of which no man can with certainty foresee—for who can
measure the passions of men?—having no one, save God,
as a witness of my thoughts, or to whom I can address myself,
do here declare, in His presence, this my last will and
testament. I bequeath my soul to God, my creator, and
pray that, in all his mercy he will accept it. I die in the
faith of the Church, and bow to its laws. I pray the good
Lord to forgive me as I have forgiven. I have striven
hard to remember some of my sins, and to abominate them.
I bow before God. I beg all that I have accidentally
injured—for by my will I never hurt human being—to forgive
me the harm they may believe I have caused them.</p>

<p>“I pray all men of charity to add their prayers to mine.
I pardon, from the bottom of my heart, all those who are
my enemies, without that I have given them cause to be
other than my friends; and I ask God to pardon them also,
for they know not what they do. I also pray pardon for
those whose zeal in my cause has done me so much harm.
I recommend to God my wife and children, my sister, my<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_300"></a>[300]</span>
aunts and brothers, and all those belonging to me through
blood, or by any other way. I pray heaven to look pityingly
upon my wife, and children, and sister, all of whom have
too long suffered with me, and to strengthen them if they
lose me, so long as they shall remain in this world. To my
wife I recommend my children, whom she has never ceased
to love; and I pray my wife to teach her children to look
upon the pomps and vanities of this world—if they should
be so unfortunate as to suffer them—only as dangerous and
vanished possessions, and to turn their thoughts to eternity.
And I pray my sister to be gentle as ever to my children,
should they have the misfortune to lose her.”</p>

<p>This is the first time, in sooth, the King betrays the least
intimation of his fears that his blood will not suffice to appease
the national rage. And even here it may be doubted
whether Louis does not rather refer to natural than violent
death, for the Princess Elizabeth was younger than the
Queen. It will be seen that, even at this pass, and solemn
moment, the King has not the least thought that the Princess
herself will be despatched below the knife of the guillotine.</p>

<p>The King’s will continued:—</p>

<p>“I pray my wife to pardon me all she has suffered, and
will suffer, on my account, and all the sorrow I may have
caused her in my life, as she may be certain I forgive her if
she can possibly suppose that she has ever caused me a
grief.</p>

<p>“I pray my children, after their love to God, which is
above all, to love one another, and to live in peace; to be
grateful and obedient to their mother; and in memory of
me, I pray them to look upon my sister as their second
mother.</p>

<p>“I pray my son, should he be so luckless as to become
King, to forget the troubles I shall have passed through, and
to forgive the people, who know not what they do, that which
they will accomplish. Let him not forget that he was
born for the happiness of his subjects; that he can only
reign safely by upholding the laws; and that he can only
do this while his power lasts. Once let him lose power, and
he becomes more injurious than ever he was useful; and,
above all, let him remember the load of debt I owe to the
children of the men who have already fallen in defending
my cause.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_301"></a>[301]</span></p>

<p>[These words are obviously the result of Louis’s study of
the history of England, of the stigma that rests upon the
memory of Charles II, through persistently ignoring the
just claims of the children of the men who had died in
the cause of his beheaded father, Charles I.]</p>

<p>The King concludes his will by recommending Cléry to
the Convention, and asking that the sword, purse, jewels,
and other ornaments taken from him may be given to that
person after the writer shall be dead.</p>

<p>He signed the will “<span class="smcap">Louis</span>,” as though he still reigned.</p>

<p>This will is sublime in its simplicity; its Christianity,
pity, regret, and massive setting aside of his life as passed away,
are all very beautiful points; while the belief that his death
would compensate all, and that the country would not visit
his faults upon the heads of his family, shows still an
amount of faith in his people which is truly touching.</p>

<p>Upon the defence being read, the King found it opened
with an appeal to the people, and a description of the wretched
condition of the royal family. The two counsel and the
King, who were the only people who heard this defence
read, and which had been put into form by the reader, Desèze,
were all moved at the beauty of the language.</p>

<p>But the King was inflexible.</p>

<p>“All that must be struck out,” he said.</p>

<p>And he insisted—for was he not a dying man? The
wishes of the dying are obeyed.</p>

<p>After the reading of the defence, the King, being left
alone with Malsherbes, he was tormented by the thought
that he could not compensate his counsel for their labors.</p>

<p>“Desèze and Trouchet,” he said, “owe me nothing.
They gave me their time, exertions, and, perhaps, their lives,
and I cannot pay them. Even if I leave a legacy, it will
not be paid. Again, what could pay such work as theirs?”</p>

<p>“Sire, you have the power of repaying them.”</p>

<p>“How?”</p>

<p>“Take them, for one mere moment, to your heart.”</p>

<p>So, next day, when the two gentlemen came, he held
open his arms, and pressed these brave men, one after the
other, to his heart.</p>

<p>This was all that he had to bestow—a royal accolade, the
peaceful kiss of a dying man.</p>

<p>At this second examination, they gave the King a suit of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_302"></a>[302]</span>
clothing, in which he looked at worst passable. But another
shape of indignity was put upon him: he was kept waiting
in a cold waiting-room during a whole hour.</p>

<p>The King was advised not to shave, that the savagery of
his gaolers in even depriving him of so common a necessary
as a razor should move his judges. But the King refused
to avail himself of this theatrical effect. He was rather
fitted to fall with dignity into the repose of death, than to
war, fight, battle for life.</p>

<p>Louis XVI forgave the men who were to condemn him
before they tried him; but his very pardon became his
most perfect revenge in the eyes of posterity.</p>

<p>The King’s counsel spoke logically, but with no power of
words. Having finished, Louis XVI, who had followed
his advocate as though rather interested for this gentleman
than for himself, rose and uttered these words:—</p>

<p>“You have now heard the grounds of my defence, and I
shall not repeat them. In speaking to you for the first, and
perhaps the last, time, I declare that I can accuse myself of
nothing; that my advocate has spoken the truth, and nothing
but the truth. I never feared that all I did should be
made public, but I grieve that you accuse me of spilling
the blood of the people. And that the misfortunes of the
10th of August are attributed to me. I had thought that
the numerous evidences of love for my people which I have
shown would have placed me above such an accusation.
This is not the case, and I must bear with what has happened.
I declare that I exposed my life to save the shedding
of one drop of the blood of my people.”</p>

<p>He turned, and left the chamber.</p>

<p>“Let him be judged!” cried Bazere.</p>

<p>“’Tis time the nation learns if she is right in wishing to
be free, and if this is a crime!”</p>

<p>“I ask,” cried Languinais, “that the sentence be declared
by a ballot of all France!”</p>

<p>“To prison with Languinais!” cried many voices.</p>

<p>“You are too openly a Royalist,” cried Thuriot.</p>

<p>“Why,” cried another, “he wills to try us, and make
Louis himself judge.”</p>

<p>“And I say,” replied Languinais, fearlessly, “that you
constitute yourselves accusers, judges, jury, and executioners.
Let the people declare themselves! Let there be liberty
of speech, to declare whether the King shall live or die.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_303"></a>[303]</span></p>

<p>“Down with him!” cried a voice.</p>

<p>“You shall hear me,” cried Languinais.</p>

<p>“Put him upon his trial! place him in the dock, and let
him instantly be tried!”</p>

<p>“To prison with him!”</p>

<p>Silence was at last restored; but when Languinais sat
down, he knew he was a condemned man—he knew nothing
could save him.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, in an ante-chamber, where the murmurs of
his judges were audible, the King’s counsel were endeavoring
to cheer him with a little hope. The people had demonstrated
with somewhat of kindly feeling in favor of the
King at various theatres.</p>

<p>On his return to the Temple, the King having nothing of
value with which he could partially repay his counsel, took
off his laced cravat and gave it to Desèze.</p>

<p>On the 1st of January, after the French fashion of wishing
friends a happy new year, Cléry approached his master’s
bed and offered him best wishes for the continuance of
his life.</p>

<p>The King put his hands together and prayed, for he
remembered that this was the day in the year when his
thousand courtiers flocked to his palace to congratulate
him.</p>

<p>Rising, he sent to ask if his daughter was better (for the
Princess was ill), and to wish the Queen <em>a happy new year</em>.</p>

<p>From the first to the 16th of January, he was kept
immured in the great tower of the Temple, perfectly isolated.
No one was allowed to see him, not even one of his
family. The fallen King passed his time reading the history
of England, especially the volumes of the life and
execution of Charles I—history which appeared to fascinate
him.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the members of the Convention were daily
disputing the question of the King’s life or death.</p>

<p>St. Just now rose to the surface. Unpityingly he cried,
“If the King is innocent, the people are guilty. You have
declared martial law against the tyrants of the whole
world, and spare your own. The Revolution only begins
where the tyrant ends.”</p>

<p>Another cried, “If with this, my hand, I alone could
strangle all tyrants, I would not hesitate to rid the world of
them.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_304"></a>[304]</span></p>

<p>But the rising party in the house lived by favor of the
eager revolutionists, whom they dared not oppose. With
them it was necessary that the King should die.</p>

<p>Another, upon another day, cried, “We have lost three
hours this day talking of a thing they call a King. Are
we, then, revolutionists? No; we are vile slaves.”</p>

<p>Camille Desmoulins stuttered, “Let him be killed, with
this word on his brow—‘Traitor!’ and this on his back—‘King!’”</p>

<p>Another cried, “Henceforth, let murderers and thieves
be buried in the royal vaults!”</p>

<p>At length the Convention agreed to the plan of every
member of the Convention voting upon these three
questions:—</p>

<p>1. Is Louis guilty?</p>

<p>2. Shall the decision of the Convention be submitted to
the ratification of the people.</p>

<p>3. What shall be the sentence?</p>

<p>To the first question, nearly seven hundred as against
about a dozen, voted “Yes.”</p>

<p>On the second, two hundred and eighty voices voted for
the appeal to the people; four hundred and twenty-three
against it.</p>

<p>It was now (January 16) that Danton first betrayed his
insatiable thirst for blood.</p>

<p>“I thought,” cried he, “we were assembled for other
purposes than those of the drama.”</p>

<p>“’Tis a question of liberty!” cried several voices.</p>

<p>“Question of liberty?” cried Danton. “’Tis a question
of a comedy—that taking off the head of a tyrant with the
axe of a King! I demand that we do not separate before
we have pronounced sentence upon Louis! His accomplices
have fallen without delay, therefore let him fall at once!”</p>

<p>Everything declared in favor of Louis’s death by this
same January 16. On this day itself, a poor fellow named
Louvain, who had been one at the taking of the Bastille,
venturing to say that the republic ought to be established
without the death of Louis XVI, a friend and companion
near him plunged his sword into his breast.</p>

<p>In the evening, a book-pedlar, suspected of royalism,
leaving a public reading-room, was accused by the people
of distributing pamphlets in favor of the King’s cause. He
was assassinated with thirty dagger-thrusts.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_305"></a>[305]</span></p>

<p>Upon this day the soldiery swept over Paris, brandishing
their swords, singing patriotic songs, and looking eagerly
for the least signs of opponents.</p>

<p>In a certain church in Paris, the hearts of passed-away
kings were kept in silver vases. These were seized and
broken open, and the contents cast into the common sewer.</p>

<p>At the Hall of the Convention a fearful scene was progressing—the
voting upon the sentence. It is night-time,
and the hurriedly raised black hangings suggest more an
execution than a place of justice. The Convention is held
in an old monastery—dark, drear, and wretched. A few
scattered lanterns make the darkness visible, and throw
a pale light upon the faces of passers-by. At the two
principal entrances are cannon, the attendant artillerymen
with the continuously lighted fuse in hand. The cannon
is there rather to be turned upon the members of the Convention
than to intimidate the people.</p>

<p>“<em>His death—or thine!</em>”</p>

<p>These were the words each Conventionist heard as he
passed into the Hall—words uttered in whispers, but which
shook the hearers as though they were thunder.</p>

<p>Persons who knew the various members were present,
who received them and commented upon their opinions.
As Danton, Marat, Robespierre and Camille Desmoulins
passed, the ranks showed all the signs of respect. Others
were threatened. Languinais passed through a forest of
thrusting pikes to reach the voting table.</p>

<p>The Hall itself was very dark, the benches being filled
with young and beautiful women of the people class. Before
them were a number of butchers, reeking from their
slaughter-houses.</p>

<p>Fifteen hours had the deputies sat—few remained. Of
those present, some were in little groups—others had fallen
asleep.</p>

<p>The first votes left everything in uncertainty. <em>Death</em>
and <em>Exile</em> were voted alternately.</p>

<p>Vergniaud, the leader of the Girondists, who had sworn
to save the King’s life, whose vote would control that of
all the Girondists, voted “<em>Death!</em>”</p>

<p>The King was doomed, because the Jacobins were all
certain to vote “Death” to a man.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_306"></a>[306]</span></p>

<p>Robespierre started, and Danton said, in a low, scoffing
voice, “These are your orators!”</p>

<p>The last man but one called to vote was the King’s
cousin, the Duc d’Orleans, Philip Equality. It was
thought the ties of nature and of blood would compel him
to vote for exile.</p>

<p>He said these words:—</p>

<p>“My thoughts being fixed wholly upon duty, convinced
that whoever shall now or hereafter attempt to establish
monarchy in this land is worthy death—I vote <em>death</em>!”</p>

<p>This man, this monster to his own blood, had in early
youth been so abject a coward, that, during a naval engagement
between the French and English, he had gone down
into the cock-pit, whence no one could induce him to
remove until the action was over. The cowardice of his
youth was well supplemented by his voting the King’s
death.</p>

<p>Even Robespierre condemned him. Returning to Duplay’s
house in the evening, he said, “The miserable man!
He was expected to listen to the pleadings of his own
heart, and vote exile; but he would not, or dared not. The
nation despises him henceforth!”</p>

<p>The monstrous act did not save him from the Reign of
Terror. He died on the scaffold—the most guilty wretch
who there ended life.</p>

<p>Followed the man Orleans, a deputy, lying on a hand-bed.
He was dying, and he voted <em>death</em>!</p>

<p>A herald arrived from the King of Spain, interceding
for the King’s life.</p>

<p>Danton rose to speak, without the Speaker’s permission.</p>

<p>“Thou art not yet King, Danton!” cried a voice.</p>

<p>“I am astounded at Spain’s insolence!” cried Danton.
“I desire that war against Spain be immediately declared!”</p>

<p>The intercession damaged, rather than benefited, the
royal cause.</p>

<p>The scrutiny of the votes now commenced.</p>

<p>Three hundred and thirty-four voted for exile or imprisonment.</p>

<p>Three hundred and eighty-seven voted for death. Thus
<em>death</em> was in a majority of fifty-three; but, by subtracting
from this number the forty-six voices which had also voted<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_307"></a>[307]</span>
a suspension of the execution of death, the majority in
favor of <em>immediate death</em> was <em>seven</em>!</p>

<p>The Girondists, who did not wish for the King’s death,
had voted his execution, and thereby favored their enemies,
the Jacobins, whose thirst for death was unquenchable.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 19th January, Louis, who had
been by this time restored to his family, saw Malsherbes
approaching him. The old man fell on his knees.</p>

<p>“I see,” said the King; “Death!”</p>

<span class="fs70 lsp2">NEAR THE BLOCK.</span></h2>


<p>The King, learning that he was to die at once, became a
man almost heroic.</p>

<p>With calm curiosity, and as though making inquiries
concerning the affairs of another man, and not of his own,
he learnt the particulars of the voting; and he made
special inquiries concerning the votes of various members
of the Convention.</p>

<p>“Pétion and Manuel,” he said,—“I am sure they did
not vote my death?”</p>

<p>No answer returned.</p>

<p>“And my cousin, the Duc d’Orleans,—how voted he?”</p>

<p>Malsherbes bowed his head.</p>

<p>The King now exhibited the first signs of pain—of
agony.</p>

<p>“That vote affects me more than all the rest.”</p>

<p>This was as the words of Cæsar, falling, “And <em>you</em>, too,
Brutus?”</p>

<p>Here a posse of authorities arrived, to announce his sentence
to the King, with all the pomp and display of circumstance.</p>

<p>The King stood up, his head erect, his eyes upon his
judges, and he listened to his fate—<em>death within twenty-four
hours</em>—with the intrepidity of a brave man. One look
towards heaven, as he heard the words which curtailed his
life, and then he was once more facing his enemies.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_308"></a>[308]</span></p>

<p>The communication read, the King advanced, and, taking
it, put the document very calmly into a little portfolio.</p>

<p>“Sir,” he said to the officiating minister of the Convention
and speaking half royally, half supplicatingly, “I request
you to deliver this letter to the Convention.”</p>

<p>The secretary hesitated to take the paper.</p>

<p>“I will read it to you,” said the King; and he commenced.
“I demand from the Convention three days, in
which to prepare my soul for God, I require freely to see
the priest, whom I am about to name, and that he be protected
while extending to me the charity of his holy office.
I demand to be freed from the shameful watchfulness which
has surrounded me now for many days past. I ask, during
these my last moments, leave to see my family when I will,
and without witnesses. And I pray most earnestly that the
Convention will at once take into consideration the fate of
my family; and that they may, after my death, at once be
allowed to go whither they will. I recommend to the love
of the nation all persons who in any way have claims on
me. These are, many of them, old men, and women, and
children. Many of them must be in want.”</p>

<p>These words show that even at this point the King had
not the least thought of the popular vengeance going beyond
himself, and falling on the Queen. He cannot comprehend
that they will kill women and children—his faith
in loyalty and manhood is too strong to admit of any such
suspicion in his breast. The faults of Louis, those rather
of apathy than action, were many; but he was a brave and
loyal gentleman, who certainly could not comprehend cowardice.</p>

<p>The name of the minister for whose holy office the King
asked, and which was written upon the separate piece of
paper, was Abbé Edgeworth de Fermont—a gentleman descended
from a good Irish family.</p>

<p>The secretary took the two papers; whereupon the King
bowed, as though dismissing his ministers at Court, thereby
intimating his desire to be left alone.</p>

<p>The minister retired.</p>

<p>When they were gone, the King walked up and down his
prison with a firm, steady step. Suddenly he looked up—his
fatal appetite, that scourge of the Bourbons, was upon
him—and asked for his dinner.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_309"></a>[309]</span></p>

<p>It was served without a knife—a spoon replacing that
utensil. He was far more indignant at these precautions
than at hearing his death-warrant read.</p>

<p>“Do they think me such a coward,” he cried, “as to deprive
my enemies of my life? Do they think if a knife is
given me to feed with, I shall save the guillotine the trouble
of destroying me? Poor creatures! I am accused of public
crimes—I have committed no crimes; and, therefore, why
should I so much fear death as to anticipate its terrors. I
die innocent, and therefore, fearlessly. I would that my
blood might atone for France, and that thereby the troubles
I foresee coming be averted.”</p>

<p>At six o’clock, Garat, the reader of the sentence, and Santerre,
had an interview with the King, to bring the answer
of the Convention to his commands.</p>

<p>The Convention had decided that no farther time should
be given to the King. A few members had shown some
sentiment of mercy. The reply was the exhibition of half
a dozen sabres on the part of the fiercer deputies, who declared
that if these men who pleaded for the concession of
the King’s request were not silent living, they should be
mute dead.</p>

<p>These courageous men, however, fought the good fight of
pity through five hours.</p>

<p>A majority of thirty-four refused all delay.</p>

<p>One man, Kersaint, protested with a reckless nobleness of
courage, which has placed him in the rank of great heroes.</p>

<p>He gave in this written protest:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<span class="smcap">Citizens</span>,—</p>

<p>“It is impossible for me any longer to support the disgrace
of sitting in the Convention with bloodthirsty men,
when their opinion, aided by terror, prevails over that of
good men. If the love of my country has forced me to endure
the misfortune of being one in a body of men amongst
whom there is a section who applaud the murders of September,
I will at least defend my memory from the charge
of having been their accomplice. I have but the present
moment in which to do this act; to-morrow it will be too
late.”</p>
</div>

<p>The Convention was angered, not confounded, by this<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_310"></a>[310]</span>
language. The Minister of Justice was charged to inform
the Citizen Louis that he could see the priest whom he had
named, and that he could see his family without any interference
by his gaolers,—but that on the morrow he must die.</p>

<p>The King accepted the decision without a murmur; for
he did not so much battle for those days’ longer life, as ask
for a few hours’ pause between life and eternity.</p>

<p>He asked Malsherbes to seek the priest.</p>

<p>“’Tis a strange request to make to one of the school of
philosophers,” he said, with a smile; “but I have always
preserved my faith as a curb on my power as a King. As a
consolation in mine adversity, I have proved it in the depths
of my prison; and if ever you should be sentenced to a
death similar to mine, I trust you may find the same solace
in your last moments.”</p>

<p>The Abbé Edgeworth and the ex-King were old and fast
friends. The priest did not hesitate a moment, and at once
hastened to the prison, albeit he knew that the probability
was that he would never be free again.</p>

<p>Abbot Edgeworth was taken from his obscure lodging, in
the first place, to the Convention, where many of the members
made a demonstration in admiration of his courage;
for, by this time, to be a priest was to be in danger of
death.</p>

<p>With the fall of the King’s head, the utter Reign of Terror
was to commence.</p>

<p>Garat, while in his carriage, conveying the Abbot to the
Temple, broke out into admiration of the King.</p>

<p>“Great heavens!” he cried, “with what a terrible
mission am I not charged! What a man is this Louis
XVI—what resignation he shows, and what courage! No
mere human strength could give such force; in this there is
something of the supernatural.”</p>

<p>The priest remained silent; he hesitated to betray himself.</p>

<p>Not a word more was said up to the moment when
the carriage stopped at the Temple.</p>

<p>The Abbé remarked that the first room through which
they passed was filled with armed men. Thence they
passed to a larger apartment, which the Abbé saw had
been a chapel; but the signs of religion had been swept
away—the altar was broken in pieces.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_311"></a>[311]</span></p>

<p>Here the Abbé was searched for weapons by a number
of rough men, while the minister passed up into the King’s
cell.</p>

<p>When the Abbé followed him, the old man fell at the
King’s feet, and burst into tears, with which the King mingled
his own.</p>

<p>“Pardon me,” said Louis, raising him, “this is indeed
weakness! I have so long lived amongst my enemies, that
I have grown to think little of their hatred, and my heart
has grown hard and callous. But the sight of an old friend
restores to me that tenderness which I thought was long
since dead, and I weep in spite of my will to be unmoved.”</p>

<p>Then, taking the priest by the hand, he drew him into the
little turret which served him for a studio. In this room,
all that was to be found consisted of a couple of chairs, a
small earthenware stove, a few books, and an ivory crucifix.</p>

<p>“I have,” said he to the Abbé, “arrived at that moment
in my life when I must earnestly seek to make my peace
with heaven, so that I may humbly hope to pass from a
weary life to one of peace and quietude.”</p>

<p>With these words, he produced his will, and read it over
twice to the Abbé, electing him as his judge in this final
act of life. He feared that, in the very act of pardoning his
enemies, he might accuse them, and he was specially desirous
that any appearance of this nature should be avoided.</p>

<p>His voice only faltered when he spoke of the Queen, his
sister, and his children. He lived now only in the love he
had for his family; apart from them, he had resigned all
thoughts of life.</p>

<p>A calm conversation ensued. The King inquired after
many old friends; speaking, not with the air of a man who
is vanishing into death, but with the appearance of a man
who, after absence, asks eagerly for those he loved and left
behind.</p>

<p>Hour after hour passed away, and still the Abbé waited
for the King to give an intimation that he wished to pray
with the minister.</p>

<p>At seven, he was to have his last interview with his family;
and as this moment approached, he appeared to dread
it far more than the thought of the scaffold.</p>

<p>He was unwilling that so great an agony as this parting
must necessarily be, should trouble the calmness of his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_312"></a>[312]</span>
death, which, obviously, he looked upon in the light of a
sacrifice.</p>

<p>The Queen and princesses had the news by this time, for
the street criers bawled the fact of the next day’s execution
of the King under the very windows of the Temple tower.
All hope was dead; and the only sentiment which swayed
them was this: would the King be prevented from taking
a last good-bye—would he be prevented from kissing them,
and blessing them, before he went forth to die?</p>

<p>One last word—one last kiss!—this was now the boundary
of the wishes of the once brilliant Marie Antoinette,
one of the proudest princesses, and, as a wife, one of the
greatest martyrs, the world has yet seen.</p>

<p>At last the members of his family were told that they
were to see the King prior to his execution. And this was
their joy in the midst of a desolation from which their only
relief was death itself.</p>

<p>The poor creatures prepared for this interview hours before
it could take place. They asked incessantly of their
gaoler if it was time for the King’s arrival, and bore
patiently with the rough, rude answer only too frequently
bestowed upon them.</p>

<p>The King himself, though apparently more calm, was
equally agitated. He had never experienced but one affection—that
for his wife; but one friendship—his sister’s;
but one joy—his children. The cares of the throne may
have hidden much of these qualities, but never extinguished
them; and, in his adversity, they had flowed back in
the shape of a wealth of consolation.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the King’s calmness, almost callousness, appears
amazing in its contemplation. Re-entering the ordinary
room, or cell, in which he passed his imprisoned days,
he began to set in order to receive the Queen.</p>

<p>“Bring some water, and a glass.”</p>

<p>Cléry pointed to a caraffe standing on the table.</p>

<p>“No,” said the King; “it is iced; and I fear, if the
Queen drinks it, that it may disagree with her.”</p>

<p>The door, at last, was thrown open, and the Queen, leading
her son, threw herself into his arms, and was about to
lead him to her chamber.</p>

<p>“No, no,” whispered the King; “I may only see you
here.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_313"></a>[313]</span></p>

<p>Madame Elizabeth followed, leading the Princess Royal.</p>

<p>Cléry closed the door upon the family; and, for the first
and last time since their return to Paris from Varennes,
they were <em>unwatched</em>. The King was almost dead, and
dead men can do no harm, even to revolutionary authorities.</p>

<p>The King gently forced his wife to sit on his right, while
his sister he placed on his left; and, as he sat down between
them, they put each an arm about his neck, and laid their
heads above the heart which, in a few hours, was to cease
heating. The Dauphin was on his father’s knee, while the
little daughter’s head lay in her father’s lap.</p>

<p>It is said that for more than half an hour not a word was
spoken; but the sudden bursts of grief, and especially the
Queen’s frantic, terrific screams, were heard not only
throughout the prison, but positively in many of the
streets adjacent to the gaol.</p>

<p>Yet nature is very good, and enables us to bear our trials
by the force of physical weakness. But soon, indeed, the
miserable family, their eyes exhausted of tears, were able
to talk in low whispers, to console each other, and to give
each other many agonized last embraces. This dread agony
lasted through an hour and a half. The ex-royal family
had been together two hours.</p>

<p>Of those five unhappy people, only the little Princess,
aged seven or eight, lived to tell in after years, what happened
at that interview. They confided to each other what
they had thought about during their separation; repeated
promises over and over again to forget and forgive all their
enemies, should either of them ever come to power; and,
finally, sublime prayers, offered by the King, to the effect
that he trusted his death might cause the nation the loss
of not one drop of blood. The directions he gave his son
(so soon to follow him into the grave) were not royal, but,
better, they were Christian.</p>

<p>Those who listened—miserable creatures—heard only a
low, sweet murmur.</p>

<p>At last the King rose.</p>

<p>The moment had arrived.</p>

<p>The Queen threw herself at the King’s feet, and entreated
him to allow her and her children to remain with him
all night. This request, in mercy, he would not grant;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_314"></a>[314]</span>
but warded off the request by gently intimating that he
must have some hours’ tranquillity, in which to gain
strength to die fittingly.</p>

<p>He, however, promised his family that they should see
him at eight in the morning.</p>

<p>“Why not at seven?” asked the Queen.</p>

<p>“Very well—at seven,” he replied.</p>

<p>“You promise?” cried the women and children.</p>

<p>He then led them to the door—they uttering louder cries
as he did so.</p>

<p>“Adieu, adieu!” he cried, in a voice equally yearning
after passing-away love, and an expression of hope in the
future.</p>

<p>The poor little Princess here fell inanimate at her father’s
feet. The attention the Queen now gave the child ameliorated
the agony of that parting.</p>

<p>The King availed himself of the heart-rending event to
turn away. He closed the door, and the agony of royalty
was ended.</p>

<p>“Ah!” he cried, entering the turret, where the Abbé
Edgeworth was awaiting him, “what a scene! Alas! why
do I love so deeply—why am I so deeply loved?”</p>

<p>He paused for a few moments; then he added, “But I
have done with to-day—let me prepare for eternity.”</p>

<p>At this point Cléry appeared, and asked the King to
take some refreshment. Louis refused at first; but even
at that ghastly pass his appetite asserted itself, and he ate
and drank during five minutes—only bread and wine; and
this he did standing, after the manner of a traveller hurrying
on a journey.</p>

<p>The priest now asked the King if he would like early in
the morning to communicate.</p>

<p>The King turned, and a last look of pleasure shone upon
his face. He was essentially a religious man, but he had
despaired of being permitted to take the communion, for
the Convention, amongst other things, had abolished the
theory and practice of the Lord’s Supper.</p>

<p>The Abbé therefore sought the commissaries on duty,
and asked for the necessary articles, without which, according
to the Roman Church, the ceremony of the communion
cannot be effected.</p>

<p>The gaol authorities were excessively confused. On the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_315"></a>[315]</span>
one hand, they were ashamed to refuse this consolation to
a dying man; on the other, the constitution of the country
then held that this belief in transubstantiation, or the
passage of the bread and wine into the actual body and
blood of Christ at their raising, was a superstition.</p>

<p>“And if we give you permission,” cried one of the leading
men, “how do we know you will not cheat the scaffold of
his blood by poisoning him with the holy wafer? It is
well known to us that certain kings have been poisoned in
the holy wafer, given to them as the very blood of the
Redeemer.”</p>

<p>“I can set that doubt at rest,” said the Abbé. “You
can yourselves supply me with both bread and wine.”</p>

<p>The hope of “communicating” elevated the dying King
almost to ecstasy. He fell upon his knees, and until far
into the night recited the simple, almost innocent, sins of
which he had been guilty. A very innocent and simple-hearted
man, the list could not have been formidable.</p>

<p>Then he lay down, and fell asleep, as calmly as a little
child—as though that final night was to be succeeded by a
long and peaceful morrow.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_LIII">CHAPTER LIII.<br>
<span class="fs70">THE SACRIFICE OF BLOOD.</span></h2>


<p>The Abbé, meanwhile, prayed unceasingly in an outer
chamber, and separated only from the King’s by a wooden
partition.</p>

<p>He and Cléry, the recently-appointed but faithful attendant
on the King, heard the condemned man’s breath regular
and peaceful, uninterrupted by cries or restlessness.
His heart beat regularly, with no more fear than is experienced
by clockwork which has nearly run down, and is
about to stop.</p>

<p>At five, it was necessary to awaken the King.</p>

<p>“Has it struck five?” he inquired, of Cléry.</p>

<p>“Not yet, by the town clock,” the man replied “but
several bells have sounded the hour.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_316"></a>[316]</span></p>

<p>“I have slept heartily,” remarked the King; “I suppose
because, yesterday, I was very much fatigued.”</p>

<p>Cléry now lighted the fire, and helped his dying master
to dress.</p>

<p>The King “communicated,” the altar being raised in
the room in which he usually sat.</p>

<p>He took the substantiated, or, rather, consecrated, bread,
with awful gravity, but with utter calmness.</p>

<p>While the priest was disrobing, the King retired to the
little turret; and here, being joined by Cléry, the good servant
knelt, and requested the King’s blessing.</p>

<p>Louis XVI raised his hand, and desired him to convey
that blessing, through himself, to all who loved their King,
and especially to those of his gaolers who had shown to the
royal family anything like pity or kindness.</p>

<p>Then, leading the valet to the window, he gave him, so
that those watching through the glass of the doors should
not see the act, a seal, which he had detached from his
watch, a small parcel, taken from his bosom, and the
wedding-ring with which, at their royal marriage, the
Queen had pledged her faith to him. This ring he took
from the hand upon which he had worn it since placed there
at his marriage.</p>

<p>“When I am dead,” he said, “you will give this seal to
my son, and this ring to the Queen. Tell her that I give
it up with great pain, and only because I do not will that it
should share in the profanity to which, of course, my body
will be subjected. And this little parcel has in it locks of
the hair of all my family. Give it, also, to my lady. Say
to the Queen, and to my most dear children, and to my
sister, that though I promised to see them this morning, I
meant to spare them the grief of another bitter separation.
It costs me more than I can describe, to go without kissing
them again!”</p>

<p>Here he wept, for the last time in his life, it being one of
the very few occasions when he was moved to tears.</p>

<p>“I give to you,” he added, in a sweet, low, suppressed
voice,—“I give to you my last farewell, to take to those I
love!”</p>

<p>Cléry retired, weeping, though his tears were an evidence
against him which might cost him his life.</p>

<p>A moment passed, and the King, leaving the little room,
asked one of the gaolers for a pair of scissors.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_317"></a>[317]</span></p>

<p>“What for, citizen?”</p>

<p>“I wish the Citizen Cléry to cut off my hair; it is the
only legacy I have to leave my family.”</p>

<p>“’Tis well,” said the gaoler.</p>

<p>And Cléry performed this ghastly office.</p>

<p>Cléry, turning to the commissaires, said, “And now,
citizens, I beg that I may be allowed to accompany the
Citizen Louis Capet”—he dared not call him King; to
do so would have terminated his own life—“to the scaffold.
I seek permission to perform this last office, and that it
may not be left to the executioner.”</p>

<p>“Bah! The executioner is good enough for <em>him</em>!” cried
one of the more influential commissaires.</p>

<p>The King turned away.</p>

<p>The Abbé, following him some moments afterwards,
found the King calmly warming himself near the stove,
and evidently contemplating his approaching end with a
certain calm joy which was to be envied by very many of
those who had condemned him.</p>

<p>“Good heavens!” he cried, “how glad I am that while
on the throne, I maintained my faith in the Eternal!
What now would be my sufferings, if I had not steadfast
hope in the world to come! Oh, yes; above there is a
Judge of courage, who cannot be influenced or threatened—who
will judge me honestly, and accord to me that
justice which has been denied me in this world.”</p>

<p>The winter day now broke, and light struggled between
the bars and planks which combined to shut out light from
the royal prisoners, one of whom was now destined soon to
be free.</p>

<p>The roll of the drum, on one side or the other far and
near, now was heard; hurried steps passed; the click of
arms could be distinguished; and soon horses, heavily
mounted, were heard beating along the street.</p>

<p>A heavier sound—cannon, and strongly-built tumbrils or
wagons were heard, taking up their position in the court-yard
of the prison, and about its entrance.</p>

<p>The King, true to the last to his marvellous character—which
his friends describe, as one not to be swayed by passion,
which his enemies analyzed to be one of callousness
and incapability of feeling, not only with regard to others,
but even for himself—the King commented on these sounds,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_318"></a>[318]</span>
not as though they affected him and his life, but as though
they were an agreeable puzzle he was putting together.</p>

<p>“’Tis probably the National Guard assembling,” he
said, in a half curious voice, to the still praying Abbé,
when the first roll of the drum swept through the cold
morning air.</p>

<p>A few moments passed, and the trampling of horses’
hoofs at the foot of the tower attracted his attention.
Then followed the voices of officers, giving military directions.</p>

<p>“They are come,” he said.</p>

<p>He spoke without impatience or fear, after the manner
of a friend quietly waiting for a friend, and at last hearing
the amicable step upon the stair.</p>

<p>And now the King’s last torture—not his execution, for
that was in mercy extended to him—commenced.</p>

<p>Through two long hours was this poor man tortured by
a refinement of cruelty for which there can be found no
extenuation, to which no parallel can be discovered.</p>

<p>Through these two hours came frequent summonses at
the door. Upon each occasion the King rose, ready. Upon
each occasion some poor, petty excuse was made. He
himself (the King) opened the door, answered the wretch
and coward who tortured him, bowed civilly when he learnt
his presence was not required, and closing the door, waited
until a fresh summons beat upon his heart.</p>

<p>Ah, posterity cannot forgive those acts! Long must the
question remain unsettled whether or not Louis XVI was
rightfully put to death. Possibly he but paid the debt his
ancestors had incurred. Millions had died of starvation.
Taxes annihilated industry through generations previous
to the uprising of the people. Even salt was weighted
with a tax which caused it to be sold at an enormous rate—thirty
pence a pound. Finally, Louis may have been
guilty, as a man who was false to his oaths to keep the
land of France free of enemies, of calling foreign help to
France. It must be felt that when his throne was sinking
from beneath him, other kings, in the interests of thrones,
being desirous of maintaining Louis upon his, would willingly
offer that foreign aid which it is felt Louis had been
more than humanly self-denying in refusing. He fell a
sacrifice to the errors of the two Louises who had preceded<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_319"></a>[319]</span>
him on the throne—a blood compensation for the waste,
luxury, and sensuality of half a dozen generations of
French nobles.</p>

<p>The measure of the people’s misery being full, they rose,
and rose successfully. Their mistake—one which ultimately
suffocated all the good it was intended they should effect—took
the shape of success, intoxicating itself with victory.</p>

<p>Give a lesson to kings not to exceed their duty—yes.
All France knew that the English Revolution, which sent
Charles I to the block, had resulted in a social condition in
England which offered an example for France to follow.</p>

<p>But having once passed upon a man the dignity of
approaching death; having thrown round him the darkness
of the coming tomb—to crush his heart—to humiliate him—to
embitter his last moments—to play with his life as a
cat with a poor, palpitating mouse—to try to resuscitate
the desire to live—to seek to change the calmness of resignation
back into the whirlpool of despair—these are not
the acts of men, but demons.</p>

<p>Yet let not these acts be set down to the people. In
times of trouble, all the scum boils to the surface, and it is
the surface we see, not the clarified water below it. Few,
very few men completed the murders of September; seven-eighths
of all France knew nothing about these wholesale
murders until they were achieved.</p>

<p>But the miserable attempt to torture the King’s last
hour upon earth failed utterly—he was beyond attack.
His soul had already passed away.</p>

<p>At nine o’clock there was a tumultuous noise upon the
staircase, and now there was a summons at the door. It
was thrown open.</p>

<p>As far as the King’s eyes could stretch were armed men—all
gazing towards Louis.</p>

<p>Santerre appeared, attended by twelve municipals, and
ten gendarmes, all of whom fell into two lines in the apartment.</p>

<p>The King turned to the little turret door, and with his
hand upon it, looked towards Santerre.</p>

<p>In this final moment all the reserve and imperiousness
of a prince returned to Louis XVI.</p>

<p>“You are come for me,” he said. “Await me—and
for a mere moment.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_320"></a>[320]</span></p>

<p>He paused, closed the door, and knelt at the minister’s
feet.</p>

<p>“It is finished,” he said. “Bless me, and let me go.”</p>

<p>A moment, and he rose, came out, placed himself smilingly
between the double row of armed men. In his hand
was a paper. It was his will. Addressing himself to the
man who appeared to be the chief of the squad, he said,
“I pray you to give this letter to the Queen.”</p>

<p>The Republicans started, and the act reminded the King
of the error he had committed.</p>

<p>“To my wife,” he said, correcting himself, to please the
Republican ears.</p>

<p>“It’s no affair of mine,” replied the man addressed, and
in savage tones. “I’m not here to carry messages to your
wife, but to take you to the scaffold.”</p>

<p>This unhappy creature, one Jacques Roux, had actually
been a priest, who had thrown off the cassock and joined
the revolutionary army.</p>

<p>“True,” said the King, his head falling.</p>

<p>But the name of a man in those ranks was to be made
illustrious amongst pitying and tender-hearted men. The
King, looking up, glanced rapidly along the two lines of
faces to find one pitying look. His eyes rested upon one
Gobeau, a man with a frightful name, but possessed of a
far better heart.</p>

<p>“I pray you give this paper to my wife.”</p>

<p>Gobeau hesitated, and looked from the King to his comrades,
from his comrades back to Louis.</p>

<p>“You may read it—if you will. ’Tis but my wishes,
which I trust the Commune may read.”</p>

<p>The man Gobeau asked the consent of his comrades, and
then took the paper.</p>

<p>The morning was very cold, and to complete the resemblance
between the fates of the two beheaded Kings,
Charles I of England, and Louis XVI of France, exactly
as Charles’s valet put a cloak round his master, so that he
should not appear to tremble at the scaffold, so Cléry,
knowing nothing of the parallel, put a cloak about his master.</p>

<p>Both kings were beheaded towards the end of January.</p>

<p>“I do not require a cloak,” he said. “Give me my
hat.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_321"></a>[321]</span></p>

<p>As he took it, he shook the faithful Cléry’s hand. Then,
turning to Santerre, and looking him full in the face, he
said, “I am ready.”</p>

<p>Santerre and his troop rather followed than escorted him.</p>

<p>The King passed down the staircase slowly, and without
any signs of tremor. Now, it is in descending a staircase
that a man, convulsed by agitation, is almost sure to
stumble.</p>

<p>The King did not make one false step.</p>

<p>Reaching the foot of the steps, the King encountered
one Mathey.</p>

<p>“Citizen Mathey,” said Louis, “you offended me very
cruelly last night, and I replied angrily. For the sake of
this hour, pray pardon me.”</p>

<p>Mathey, instead of replying, pretended to turn his head
away, and not see the King. However, it is only just to
say, in some extenuation of the brutality of most of those
to whom the King addressed himself during the last hour
of his existence, that death was now so quickly dealt to
any man whose words could be twisted into an expression
of even pity for fallen royalty, that it was only at the risk
of exposing life that a man could be humane in an answer
to any question addressed to him by any one of the royal
family.</p>

<p>The King was now crossing the court-yard. He had
achieved half the distance before his heart failed him; and,
turning yearningly, he looked towards the tower within
which the Queen was confined. A moment, and his face
was towards the people glaring in at the gate. Once more
he looked, as he passed out of the court-yard; then he,
death, and eternity were alone!</p>

<p>A carriage awaited him, an armed man standing each
side the door. One of these men entered the carriage, and
took a front seat; the King followed, and took the place of
honor—the right, facing the horses. The Abbé Edgeworth
followed, and sat beside Louis. The second gendarme now
entered, and slammed and fastened the door, and the carriage
was at once started.</p>

<p>Sixty drums lead the way, incessantly sounding, and a
mass of armed men surrounded the victim.</p>

<p>The reign of terror had begun, in truth. A Governmental
order had been issued, forbidding any citizen to show<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_322"></a>[322]</span>
himself at a window; and the infraction of such an order
was, in itself, probably a condemnation to death. The
citizens were also forbidden to cross any of the streets upon
the line of march.</p>

<p>A strange effect was this procession.</p>

<p>The morning was lowering, cold, dead, and damp; and
the noisy sixty drums, purposely used to drown any cry
that might be raised, led the way for a hurried, half-disciplined,
half-armed horde of armed men; in their midst,
a carriage, half-filled with two such as those who formed
the escort.</p>

<p>And this procession marched through a double row of
steel—of pikes and bayonets, held by silent men. At distances
were squads of the regulars, armed and prepared as
for an action in the field.</p>

<p>A strange sight! Thousands of armed men—soldiers
with cannon and musket, prepared against a numerous foe;
a swiftly passing crowd of men, armed to the teeth, jealously
guarding a carriage half-filled with two such as they
themselves were,—all against—what?</p>

<p>Sixty drums beating to drown—utter silence! Two
hundred thousand men, to keep order amongst—space!
Armed men—and that was all!</p>

<p>On the line, not a human being to be seen beyond the
serried lines of armed men. Not a woman’s form for the
eye to rest on—every window blind, every street passed, a
desert. Paris was a city of the dead. Even the marketplaces
were silent, and not even the voice of a child was to
be heard.</p>

<p>Cannon gaped at every street corner, the artillerymen
holding lighted matches; in a word, on all sides were to be
seen evidences of preparations to meet a formidable enemy—on
not one was the shadow of an enemy to be seen.</p>

<p>The King could scarcely be perceived though the forest
of steel in which he was lost. He wore a brown coat and
a white waistcoat. His hair was raised up already for the
executioner’s hands.</p>

<p>So great was the noise created by the drums, that he
could not hear what the Abbé Edgeworth said, or even
what he himself said to that self-devoted gentleman.</p>

<p>Therefore he took the minister’s breviary, and opened it
at those particular psalms which he had learnt in his captivity,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_323"></a>[323]</span>
suited to his situation. These he began to recite while
the priest prayed beside him.</p>

<p>It is said the expression of the two men-at-arms were
those of astonishment and admiration.</p>

<p>All these warlike preparations were met by the opposition
of seven or eight opponents.</p>

<p>The procession moved from the Temple up to the boulevards,
the line of which was kept by the procession, until
it reached the place of execution, on that spot which is now
the <span lang="fr">Place de la Concorde</span>. At that point on the line of
march which now lies between the Portes St. Denis and St.
Martin, occurred the one sign of any opposition to the
tragedy which was about to be completed.</p>

<p>There was a sudden stir; and, suddenly, seven or eight
young men, sword in hand, rushed from the Rue Beauregard,
dashed forward through the line of armed men, and
even reached the carriage, they crying, “Help, help, those
who would save the King!”</p>

<p>The leader of these frantically-daring young men was one
Baron de Batz, a man of extremely adventurous tendencies.
Chiefly by his means, three thousand young men had combined
to effect this diversion in the King’s favor, and they
were to respond to the call to arms led by Batz.</p>

<p>The three thousand made no reply; the seven or eight
devoted men stood alone in the midst of nearly a quarter
of a million of armed enemies.</p>

<p>But some mercy was shown them, for those about them
did not massacre the youths,—they were all very young.
They even escaped into a side street; but here they were
fallen upon by a squad of gendarmes, rapidly told off for
that purpose; and being caught sword-in-hand, they were
shot down, and left where they fell.</p>

<span class="fs70">EXECUTION OF LOUIS XVI.</span></h2>


<p>As the <span lang="fr">Place de la Revolution</span>, the place of execution,
came in view, a ray of sunshine fell upon the guillotine—one<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_324"></a>[324]</span>
of those coincidences which the superstitious and the
wonder-loving remember and treasure up.</p>

<p>This open space was filled with a hundred thousand of
the lowest rabble; soldiers thick about the scaffold; and
high above the people stood a something, the woodwork of
which was painted a blood-color.</p>

<p>This was the <em>guillotine</em>!</p>

<p>The guillotine had only just been introduced. It had
been invented in Italy, and imported into France by a
humane doctor, named Guillotin, whose name was cruelly
taken and applied to the machine, an “e” being added to
make it feminine—for, according to the custom of most
men in most times, a something terrible and merciless is
always feminine. If the women had the naming, perhaps
the other gender would as frequently be applied to things
of terror.</p>

<p>The guillotine was essentially a humane invention.
Previous to its introduction, the condemned man knelt
down and placed his head on a block. A headsman then
with an axe endeavored to sever the head from the body.
The least swaying on his part, and instead of death, a
wound was the result. Often an executioner, unnerved by
the failure of his first blow, would hack and chop many
times before the victim ceased to show signs of life, and
before the head was off the body.</p>

<p>The guillotine exactly fell in with the views of the
equallist Republicans, for they objected to the executioner,
because it was a disgrace to a man to be an executioner.
On the other hand, the guillotine, consisting of a heavy,
razor-like knife, which worked in grooves, and fell upon a
neck irrevocably placed below the knife, the head was
separated at a blow, in a moment, and death achieved with
the least possible cruelty.</p>

<p>But if the guillotine was merciful—and of this there
can be no doubt—on the other hand—it may be questioned
if so many people would have been condemned to death
during the Reign of Terror if the old slow mode of decapitation
had remained.</p>

<p>By a singular fatality the head of Guillotin himself was
taken off by the very instrument he had introduced from
Italy into France.</p>

<p>All the vagabondage of Paris was present at this execution.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_325"></a>[325]</span>
The trees bent under the masses of people who had
climbed into them. There was not breathing room, while,
by connivance of the most bloodthirsty of the revolutionary
leaders, the spaces immediately round the scaffold were
occupied by the men who had effected the massacre of
September.</p>

<p>These men were there to applaud.</p>

<p>But when the carriage containing the King drew up before
the scaffold, the mob was silent—even the September
men, for a little time, held their peace.</p>

<p>The King perceiving the carriage stop, looked up, and
said to the Abbé, “We have arrived, I think.”</p>

<p>The minister replied by a gesture.</p>

<p>One of the three brothers Sanson, the three executioners
of Paris, opened the door.</p>

<p>The gendarmes got out, whereupon the King, closing the
door, and placing his hand upon the minister, he said
authoritatively to those who were pressing forward, “Gentlemen,
I recommend this gentleman to your care. Be
brave enough to save him from insult after I am dead. I
charge you to save him!”</p>

<p>No one replied.</p>

<p>“I charge you to save him!”</p>

<p>One of them, more sinister than the rest, replied.</p>

<p>“Yes, yes,” he said; “be at peace—we will save him,
and let us hear no more about it.”</p>

<p>Louis now stepped from the carriage.</p>

<p>Three executioners’ attendants came forward, and wished
to undress him at the foot of the scaffold.</p>

<p>He waved them back, took off his coat, cravat, and
turned down his shirt.</p>

<p>The executioners again approached him.</p>

<p>“What do you seek to do?” he asked, angrily.</p>

<p>“Bind you!” they said, seizing his hands.</p>

<p>“Bind <em>me</em>!” the King cried, all the passion of centuries
of petted and idolized royal blood rising in the veins which
were now in a few moments to be empty. “Never!—I
will not permit it. Do your work, but you shall not bind
me—do not even dream of such a thing!”</p>

<p>This man, the descendant of hundreds of kings, could
not, even after recommending his soul to God, uncrown himself.
The Convention might call him a citizen—but he had,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_326"></a>[326]</span>
as all kings must, lived in the belief of that half-divinity
which is still in some places supposed to surround a king.</p>

<p>The executioners had their duty to do. Here was a man
to be guillotined. Men who were guillotined had to be
bound. Then they must bind their man.</p>

<p>They again approached.</p>

<p>A veritable struggle was about to commence at the foot
of the scaffold.</p>

<p>The King saved himself from himself in time. He remembered
the dignity of his death, and he looked towards
the Abbé.</p>

<p>“Sire,” said the man of religion, “compare yourself to
One far greater than yourself, who was bound with cords,
and who will soon welcome you as a brother.”</p>

<p>The King looked to heaven, appeased, but the royal pride
still lingered.</p>

<p>“Truly, only the Divine example enables me to bear this
disgrace.”</p>

<p>It is probable this final demonstration, in his very extremity,
of his superiority to touch from common hands,
helped to harden the nation against the life of the widow.
On the other hand, it proved the first occasion on which he
showed the least sign of impatience with his tormentors.</p>

<p>“Do as you will,” he said. “I will drink the cup to the
dregs.”</p>

<p>Supported by the help of the aged minister, he ascended
the steps of the scaffold, and, it must be admitted, with signs
of physical fear—the first he had yet shown. Possibly this
condition of body was chiefly brought about by the actual
physical resistance he had made at the foot of the ladder.
But upon coming to the level, all his natural calmness or
courage, whichever it was, came to his aid; and, stepping
quickly forward across the platform without help, he contemplated
the means of his death.</p>

<p>Suddenly, he turned, and faced the people, and used the
royal gesture of his life. It was quite natural—a habit of
his life—and testified to no violent defiance of his position,
and of those who placed him where he stood.</p>

<p>The drummers mechanically obeyed.</p>

<p>“People,” he said, in a voice which was heard afar off,
even in the very confines of the square,—“People, I die
innocent of all the crimes of which I am declared guilty. I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_327"></a>[327]</span>
forgive those who send me to death, and I pray God that
the blood you are about to shed may not fall upon France.”</p>

<p>The crowd trembled—murmured.</p>

<p>He was about to speak again, when the officer of the
troop gave orders to the drums to beat and the King’s voice
was drowned.</p>

<p>He had said enough. Nothing could add to the majesty
of those few words. The agony was spared him of learning
who the man was that gave the order which drowned
his last words. It was the Count d’Oyat, a natural son of
Louis XV; and therefore by blood, if not by marriage, the
King’s uncle—Louis XVI being the grandson of Louis XV.</p>

<p>What a fate! His cousin voted for his death, and the
last words he uttered were drowned by the command of his
uncle.</p>

<p>The condemned man turned slowly away. As they fastened
him to the plank, he cast one look upon the praying
minister, and the next moment the plank was sinking forward,
carrying down Louis of France, his face towards the
earth.</p>

<p>Another moment—the time for the passage of the heavy
blade—and Louis of France was dead!</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_LV">CHAPTER LV.<br>
<span class="fs70 lsp2">WHAT FOLLOWS.</span></h2>


<p>I saw Louis XVI die.</p>

<p>“Go,” said Robespierre, “see liberty declared, and a
King proved to be no more than a man.”</p>

<p>I stood amongst those at the foot of the scaffold.</p>

<p>I will say no more than this—Louis died bravely, and
like a man. And I think the people were sorry. Of course
they had more to regret before the Reign of Terror was
over.</p>

<p>Robespierre changed nothing in his mode of life after
he came to Duplay’s. He drank water, he lived very temperately
and frugally, was always master of himself. By
the way, another of Duplay’s daughters coming home, Maximilian<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_328"></a>[328]</span>
actually fell in love with her, in a grave, calm way;
and it was agreed that, when liberty was completely obtained,
and France was at peace, that they should be married,
live in a cottage, and hide away from the world.</p>

<p>I had frequently been at the Temple during the incarceration
of the King, and often saw various members of the
unhappy family. I am desirous that my hearers should believe
that the men who surrounded the Capets in their imprisonment,
were no more good examples of the revolutionary
masses than I am an angel. A few hundred ferocious
men rose to the surface of the Revolution, and disgraced it.
At heart, its adherents sought to make France happy, and
the people richer.</p>

<p>But let me return to the course of events.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>There is very little known of what the widowed Queen
did or said during the night before the execution, and upon
that morning itself, beyond the fact that she passed from
prayer to insensibility continuously. The entire family
seem to have been conscious, from the first, that the separation
with the King, on the eve of the execution, was final—that
his promise to see them in the morning was a pious
fraud.</p>

<p>As the morning progressed, after she knew by the lessening
noise of the drums that he was on the way to execution,
her great anxiety appeared to be to ascertain the exact moment
when he died, so that from praying for him, she might
entreat his soul to pray and plead for her and his children.</p>

<p>The loud cries of “Long Live the Republic,” and the
rumbling return of the cannon, were the first evidences she
received that all was over.</p>

<p>She appears from that time to have passed into a state of
half-unconscious moroseness—a condition which is one of
the mercies of nature, and which only ended in her life.</p>

<p>She knew, she said, that he would die like a man, and
that was her consolation, when, with a cruelty beyond
measure, she was refused any information concerning his last
moments.</p>

<p>Cléry, the valet, now, apart from her family, the dearest
being to her in all the world, as the man who had been with
the King during his last days,—Cléry was now a prisoner,
and remained one during a whole month, during which time<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_329"></a>[329]</span>
he had not the faintest approach to an opportunity to give
the Queen the King’s last words, or place in her keeping the
hair and ring with which the King had entrusted him.</p>

<p>About these relics there is a strange bit of tender history.
One Toulan concealed under the most frantic demonstrations
of Republicanism, a sacrificial devotion to the royal family.
He feared these relics would be wilfully destroyed by some
drunken, ruthless hand; and pretending that he would not
allow the chance of their being delivered to the Queen, he
insisted on their being placed under the keeping of the
chief officers of the Commune.</p>

<p>The Queen asked very humbly permission to wear mourning
for the King, and this was granted, on condition of extreme
parsimony and meanness.</p>

<p>There was a special debate, in order to obtain the Dauphin
a few shirts.</p>

<p>The more merciful men of the Revolution fully expected
that the death of the King would be followed by the liberation
of the Queen, her children, and the Princess Elizabeth.
This hope being held out to the Princess Elizabeth, she
carried the grateful news to the Queen, who heard it, without
interest, and returned an answer almost stupid to this
good news. Either she knew that a nation who had not
spared her husband would not spare her, who had always
been the least liked of the two, or she did not care to live.
Probably the latter surmise is the nearer correct.</p>

<p>Her only expression of resolution took place when she
was requested for her health’s sake to walk in the garden of
the prison. She resolutely refused. She said she could not
pass the door of the King’s prison—could not put her feet
upon the stairs down which he had marched to death. It
was only at the end of six weeks—at the close of February—that
she consented, for the sake of the children, who
never left her side, to walk on the platform at the top of the
tower. Here, between the battlements of the parapet, she
could be seen from the neighboring houses; and this tending
to create pity, it was ordered that the spaces between the
battlements should be filled up with boards—an order which
pleased the Queen, for it shut out from her sight a city
which, to her, appeared a mere charnel-house. This intended
petty cruelty—which was a relief—took place towards
the end of March.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_330"></a>[330]</span></p>

<p>The King had now been dead ten weeks, and Marie Antoinette
had yet to live six cruel months.</p>

<p>Her bodily health was breaking, but she had no knowledge
of this fact. Her heart was dead. She was simply
decaying. For whole nights she would lie awake, never
complaining, never showing signs of weariness.</p>

<p>Her life had passed into <em>wailing</em>. She was weary almost
of the love of her children. Upon the face, and in her step,
walk, in every gesture, and at rest, at last, or awake, the
woman appeared to be pleading, “Good Lord, how long
shall this endure?”</p>

<p>She was now more closely watched. The Princess Elizabeth,
at peace, become essentially a religious woman, contrived
to obtain intelligence of what was happening. One
Huc—once valet to the King when in prosperity—conveyed
messages through the friendly Toulan into the prison.
These messages were put in the pipe of a portable fireplace,
and found by the Princess Elizabeth, who replied in letters
written with sympathetic ink, so that only those who knew
how to treat them could read their contents.</p>

<p>These letters contained minutes of all that was doing in
Europe in the royal cause. Many promising lines thus
came to the prison. The Queen heard them read, said a
vacant word or two, and sank back into her usual condition
of partial lethargy.</p>

<p>She only came back to life when she heard the voices of
either of her children. Then she lived. When they were
silent, she was dead, though her heart still beat.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_LVI">CHAPTER LVI.<br>
<span class="fs70">THE REIGN OF TERROR.</span></h2>


<p>The remains of Louis XVI were conveyed in a cart to
the graveyard, flung into a hole, and lime cast upon the
remains, that the bones might never be found, in order to
be exalted into relics.</p>

<p>Paris was silent—except for the voices of the more excited
of the Revolutionists, who overran the city, announcing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_331"></a>[331]</span>
the death of the tyrant, and proclaiming the advent of liberty.</p>

<p>The body of the people did not respond to this enthusiasm—they
did not confound punishment with victory. The
body of the King was not cold before the people began asking
themselves whether or not a righteous act had been
committed. The King’s death left this problem to be discussed
by the nation. Many years have elapsed as I write,
and the problem is still discussed—had the people a right
to kill Louis XVI?</p>

<p>The result of the King’s death upon the more moderate
Republicans, and upon those who had agreed to the new
constitution, but were Royalists at heart, were in some
cases terrible. To many, this execution appeared a sacrilege,
which must bring down upon the people who had committed
it one of those vengeances in which heaven demands
for the spilt blood of one just man the blood of an entire
people.</p>

<p>Men died of grief when they learnt the awful facts, and
many more went mad.</p>

<p>Women cast themselves in panic from housetops, others
from the bridges into the River Seine.</p>

<p>Sisters, wives, and mothers of the Conventionalists, who
had condemned lovers to death, shrank from them as from
lepers.</p>

<p>One of the principal judges at the trial, Michael Lepelletier,
was almost immediately stabbed in an eating-house by
one Paris, a hot-headed Royalist, who escaped only for a
short time. Tracked, he shot himself; and upon the body
was found a paper bearing these words:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I alone did the deed—let no other man be suspected.
I did not mean to kill the wretch, Lepelletier, but he came
in my way. I was waiting for the parricide D’Orleans, of
whom I hoped to rid the world. All Frenchmen have
become cowards.”</p>
</div>

<p>Three days after, Lepelletier was publicly buried, after
the antique Greek mode, and thousands were squandered
upon this pomp.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the nations were rising against France,
although about this time the Prussians had been worsted
by the French on the eastern frontiers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_332"></a>[332]</span></p>

<p>In England, the horror produced was great; and one
Chauvelin having returned from London to Paris, declaring
to the Convention that the English masses were ready to
rise and massacre the King (George III) in his palace, the
French ambassador at London was ordered to leave England
within twenty-four hours.</p>

<p>The Convention thereupon declared war against Holland
and England.</p>

<p>Catharine II, of Russia, revoked the treaty of 1786, by
which the French were more favored in Russia, than other
foreigners; and ordered all the French in Russia to return
to France, who would not swear that they abhorred revolutionary
sentiments. This Empress joined the coalition
against France.</p>

<p>The Convention had already declared war against Spain.</p>

<p>And now, England, Prussia, Austria, Russia, and Spain
were all at war with France—which was at war with itself.</p>

<p>Even Sweden had declared against the Republic. Not a
friendly national face looked upon France beyond the boundaries.</p>

<p>In mercy to what was now to happen to France, let it be
said that, cast upon her own resources, the armies of other
people advancing upon her by land, and by sea, despairing
of help from the United States, which had not yet recovered
the blood spilt in obtaining her independence, France
was panic-stricken at the fear of civil war, and rashly
sought, by the most unpardonable acts, to exterminate
this probability by the extermination of all those who
were suspected of favoring Royalism.</p>

<p>The leader of blood amongst the Conventionists, immediately
after the execution of Louis XVI, took the
hideous form of Marat. Dirty, mean, fetid, disgusting in
look and action, he endeared himself to the most foul
amongst the lowest by these attributes. But, like Robespierre,
who was a very fop in appearance and action, he
accepted no public money, and lived most obscurely in
three or four garret-like rooms, most meanly furnished.
This man was the idol of the commonest people, who
saluted him almost as though a God: and he must have
had some occult power of attraction, for a woman really
beautiful devoted her life and honor to this creature.
Nor was he without the sentiment of self-sacrifice; for,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_333"></a>[333]</span>
though dying, though every violent speech he made,
which was always prefaced by the cry “<em>Blood!</em>” brought
him nearer to the grave, he never hesitated to exert himself,
and quitted his bed or his bath, in which he passed
the greater part of his time, to go down to the Convention,
and denounce men on the most frivolous pretences.</p>

<p>The moderate party in the Convention—the Girondists—who
in theory desired to save the King, and in practice
condemned him to death, were by this time in danger.
They were in the way of the fiercer party, led by Marat,
Danton, and Robespierre, who were to eclipse both; and
these Girondists were already in the hands of their opponents,
condemned to follow the King to the scaffold.</p>

<p>It was in such language as the following that Marat,
who gained a poor living as the editor of a very fierce paper,
spoke, in his <cite>Friend of the People</cite>:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I pray my readers pardon me to-day if I speak of
myself; not because I am vain, or a fool, or because I
wish to serve the people, and, therefore, must justify myself
in their sight; for I am accused of being a monster,
greedy of blood—a tiger, longing for gore!</p>

<p>“Born with a sensitive heart, carefully nurtured, at
twenty-one, I was pure, and had long since given myself up
to knowledge.</p>

<p>“My mother gave much in charity, and all she gave
passed through my hands. At eight, I could not endure
cruelty, and the sight of it enraged me to madness.</p>

<p>“As a child I was weak, and never did I know the joys
of childhood. I was so loved, that I was never punished
but once, when eleven, and then unjustly. I sprang from
the window of the room in which I was confined, and found
liberty in the streets, where, even now, only liberty is to
be found.”</p>
</div>

<p>He concluded this article:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Restored to health, I only thought how I could be
useful to the cause of freedom. And yet they accuse me
of having sold myself,—I, who could amass millions by
merely selling my silence,—I, who am in poverty and
want!”</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_334"></a>[334]</span></p>

<p>Strange enough, like Robespierre, Marat firmly believed
he was an instrument in the hands of God. “The
Revolution,” he would say, “is the Gospel, and I am its
apostle.”</p>

<p>But all the raving in the world could not hide the fact
that France had suddenly become poor. To be rich, was
to run the risk of being accused of being an aristocrat.
And as all gold and silver was in the hands of the rich,
and these were flying from France, the land was actually
being drained of specie.</p>

<p>Paper money was issued—a currency which the people
mistrusted, as the people always mistrust the unusual; and
the Girondists were popularly accused of causing the disappearance
of the precious metals.</p>

<p>The walls of popular hate were closing round that score
of devoted men.</p>

<p>The aspect of the land was horrible. People feared to
go about in anything but rags, dreading to be supposed
rich, and therefore only fit to die; land remained uncultivated,
for its owners had fled; and the half-destroyed, empty
houses of the nobility began falling into ruins. Not a carriage
was to be seen, nor a jewel, nor any sign of luxury.
All was abject, wretched, debased. The bakers’ shops were
almost like prisons (to this day, bakers’ shops in Paris are
often barred); and the only prodigality was that of wine,
the many years store of which flowed in terrible abundance.
It was cheaper than bread, and steeled the heart to pity.
Commerce had ceased, and not a sail beyond that of a
French fishing-smack was to be seen in the French waters.</p>

<p>Marat now advocated the pillage of every store-house in
the land, and the hanging of some of the owners in their
own gateways, as an example to the rest.</p>

<p>And now that which was most feared occurred—civil
war. La Vendée, in the north-west of France—the Brittany
of to-day—rose almost to a man, and defied the republic.</p>

<p>Spain now began to pour her soldiers upon the south,
while Austrians and Prussians were gaining victory after
victory in the north and east.</p>

<p>So north, south, east, and west, enemies’ faces were
turned upon France, while England was preparing to sweep
her navy around the whole of the coasts of the now devoted
land.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_335"></a>[335]</span></p>

<p>The Convention commanded that a black flag should
float from the towers of the Cathedral of Notre Dame de
Paris.</p>

<p>The theatres were closed.</p>

<p>Only one cry was heard in the streets—“To arms—to
arms!”</p>

<p>Danton and Robespierre now quarrelled. One Legendre
undertook to reconcile them, and they met without previous
warning. Danton, a bull-dog in ferocity, and with the bull-dog’s
generosity advanced, and held out his hand. Robespierre,
with the silent stealth of the tiger, which waits and
pounces, affected not to see it, ate his dinner in silence, and
went away, after the utterance of a few words, which were
the first that openly indicated his intention of betraying
Danton.</p>

<p>Danton was beginning to repent. His remorse was natural.
He had lost his wife, whose death had been accelerated
by terror. Unable to endure his loneliness, he sought
another wife; her parents rejected him with loathing. But,
after a little, they pitied his misery, and gave their daughter
to this strangely compounded man.</p>

<p>Danton now contemplated what was done after Napoleon
had reigned and lived, after Louis XVIII had reigned and
died, after Charles X had been driven from the French throne—the
giving of a King to France, not belonging directly
to the hated Bourbons, but to the younger branch, the
Orleanists, the leader of whom, Philip Equality, had voted
Louis XVI’s death. He was never crowned; he died on the
scaffold. His son, Louis Philippe, ultimately became King
of France.</p>

<p>Philip Equality refused the proposal.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the Convention was becoming a mere field of
battle. On one particular night, the two sides clash—a
poniard is drawn, a pistol is clapped to a breast, and murder
is nearly done. It is felt that one party must be swept
away, or nothing will be done. The moderate party, the
Girondists, twenty-two in all, are to-night nearer the scaffold
by a long journey than they were in the morning.</p>

<p>Marat is declared a traitor by two hundred and twenty
voices, against ninety-two. Marat defies the vote, throws
himself into the arms of the people, and is borne home in
triumph.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_336"></a>[336]</span></p>

<p>The people rise in his favor.</p>

<p>On the 24th of April (the Queen has been waiting death
during three months) Marat is strong enough to appear
and defy Parliament. He commands them to declare him
innocent of treason. This defiance is carried to the thousands
of armed men waiting the issue outside the House of
Assembly. A cannon-like roar from the people declare their
will—and he is pronounced innocent.</p>

<p>The people place him on a plank, the throne of the people,
and bear him through the streets, after crowning him
with flowers.</p>

<p>“It is you, the people,” he cries, “who crown themselves
upon my head. I am the King of Poverty. May every
head, which would rear itself above the level of the people
soon fall, when I cry ‘<em>Kill!</em>’”</p>

<p>A few days, and, in his arrogance, he says to his brother
Conventionists, “I hold you as a little water in the palm
of this hand; and as readily as I spill it, so I can spill the
blood of all of you!”</p>

<p>By this time, Philip Equality, for what he had been—a
Duke—had become hated of the people. Strangely enough,
he who had been so cowardly as a youth, now, when his
life was threatened, became brave. When he was arrested,
he was perfectly calm; when separated from the elder of
his two sons, he was perfectly resigned. He had turned
from his family to serve the people, and he now wore their
chains.</p>

<p>The people now demanded the deaths of all the leaders
of the more moderate Conventionists.</p>

<p>“<em>Death to the twenty-two!</em>”</p>

<p>The people had slain a King—therefore they began to
demand the lives of those who sought, as Republicans, to
govern the stricken land.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_LVII">CHAPTER LVII.<br>
<span class="fs70">WHOLESALE MASSACRE.</span></h2>


<p>The twenty-two deputies were already condemned by
the will of the ensanguined mob.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_337"></a>[337]</span></p>

<p>On the eve of the last day in May (1793), of those
twenty-two, only one, the leader, Vergniaud, slept in his
own home. The others feared an assassination, and sought
the aid of friends.</p>

<p>A vote being carried against the moderates, the victors
proposed to walk with the people through the city, which
was illuminated. The Girondists, as a measure of precaution,
joined in the procession.</p>

<p>While the procession was progressing, that now organized
band, the Revolutionary Committee, sent to
arrest Madame Roland’s husband.</p>

<p>That evening, Roland, who does not show well in this
business, fled into hiding. Madame Roland then determined
to go down to the Convention and upbraid it. So
far, the French had not begun to behead women. Starting
from her home, she was surprised to find the city had been
suddenly illuminated. Making her way to the Convention,
she found it closed. And she learnt that the moderate
party were overthrown, and that they would soon be headless.</p>

<p>She returned home, to await her fate. She did not seek
to fly. Roland, poor man, remained in concealment—only,
after a time, to be ashamed of his cowardice, and to commit
suicide.</p>

<p>She prepared to send away her daughter to trusted
friends, made up a packet of clothing to take with her to
prison, and waited. At midnight, they came beating at
her door, and she had to be awakened; for no fear of death
deprived her of that balm of life—sleep.</p>

<p>“How much you are beloved!” said the leader of the
sectionaries, seeing the eagerness with which the young
daughter kissed her mother.</p>

<p>“Because I love,” she replied, proudly.</p>

<p>Reaching the carriage waiting for her, she was asked if
she would have the window closed.</p>

<p>“No,” she replied; “I have done no harm, and I can
face my enemies.”</p>

<p>“You are braver than many men waiting the decree of
justice.”</p>

<p>“If in France there were justice, <em>I</em> should not be seated
with <em>you</em>. I shall go to the scaffold as fearlessly as I go to
prison. I despise life.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_338"></a>[338]</span></p>

<p>Marat now became supreme. “Rise, sovereign people!”
he cried; “no man dare oppose you.”</p>

<p>There was never given a more fearful impetus to murder
than these words.</p>

<p>What it pleased men to call a Committee of Public
Safety was now organized, and its operation was the killing
of every human being who could by any means be made to
appear not utterly to sympathise with the seething mob.</p>

<p>The Convention existed, but its power was completely at
an end. Its votes were laughed at. Queen Guillotine was
the one power left in France.</p>

<p>Every day the foreign arms directed against France
obtained successes. Meanwhile, the land was like a vessel
without a rudder. No man was strong enough to control
the mob. Indeed, it was only when Napoleon Bonaparte
rose, that internal peace was established. It is not to be
wondered at that he came to be looked up to as a demigod.</p>

<p>Twenty thousand Royalist volunteers were now in arms
against Marat, in one department of France alone.</p>

<p>Marat was at this time King of Paris. Robespierre
was waiting. Danton was threatening and trembling at
the same time. Another week, and the foul Marat would
have conquered both, and been proclaimed, by the voice of
the streets, President of the Republic.</p>

<p>But his hideous career was to be arrested by the feeble
hand of a girl—Charlotte Corday.</p>

<p>Just before the commencement of the Reign of Terror
in France, there might have been seen in a quiet corner of
a quiet old street in Caen (that city in Normandy so much
mixed up with the early history of English), a quiet old
house, called the Grand Manor—a house around a court-yard,
in the centre of which was a mossy fountain. Near
this fountain, through the sunny hours, might frequently
be seen a very beautiful girl, the niece of an aged woman,
who was the maiden’s aunt. This was Charlotte Corday.
Fair of skin, and grey of eye, her hair was what had not
inaptly been termed gilded-black. In other words, it was
black hair, golden-tipped, with golden lines veining it.
She was always dressed plainly, in brown cloth, and her
voice was sweet and lingering. No man has ever breathed
a word against her character.</p>

<p>By a peculiar course of study—which it is needless to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_339"></a>[339]</span>
analyze—she had brought herself to that condition of mind
when the sufferer experiences the belief that a self-sacrifice
of some nature must be made, in order to appease an inexplicable,
unknown longing to do some good—a something
which is supposed to be good—in the world.</p>

<p>She was essentially a Republican; but gradually, slowly,
the conviction enchained her, that Marat was its monster,
and that he must die. Her resolve appears to have been
hastened by the departure of her lover, who joined the
Caen volunteers. This gentleman, one Franquelin, was, it
is said, accused by Marat as a conspirator against the republic,
and assassinated by villains hired for that purpose.
He did not die on the spot, as it was at first reported, but
returned home after Charlotte Corday’s execution. His last
words were an entreaty to his mother to bury with him
Charlotte’s portrait, and all the letters she had ever written
to him.</p>

<p>Supplemental to the latter motive, Charlotte Corday
believed Marat was ruining all France. Here she believed
truly.</p>

<p>She obtained a letter to one of the Conventionists. No
one had the slightest idea of her intentions. She retained
a sweet, soft gaiety, which was quite natural to her, and
which accompanied this lady to the scaffold. An anecdote
is very characteristic of her life. Just before she started
for Paris, passing a <i lang="fr">café</i>, outside of which some men were
card-playing, she said, “Cards! Do you know your
country is dying?”</p>

<p>Taking a sheet of drawing-paper one morning, she said,
“Aunt, I am going to sketch the hay-makers—kiss me.”</p>

<p>Going out, she met a child, of whom she was very fond.</p>

<p>“Here, Robert,” she said, giving him the drawing-paper;
“kiss me, and be a good boy. You will never see me again.”</p>

<p>She chattered in the coach most of the way to Paris.
One young man fell in love with her, and asked to apply to
her friends. She mirthfully repulsed him, and told him to
wait, at least for some days.</p>

<p>It was now July. On the eleventh of that month, Charlotte
Corday reached Paris. At five in the afternoon she
retired to rest in a public-house, and slept until next day,
when she presented her letter at the house of the Conventionist,
Duperret. When she saw him, she vaguely entreated<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_340"></a>[340]</span>
him to flee from Paris. “After to-morrow evening,”
she said, “it will be too late.”</p>

<p>Duperret spoke of her as a beautiful girl, slightly deranged.</p>

<p>Her great desire was to remain unknown by name in
connection with the death of Marat. With this view, she
determined to kill him before the people, so that she might
at once be torn to pieces, and her mutilated face be beyond
recognition. But she learnt that Marat was so ill that he
could not appear in public again. He still issued, daily,
stronger and more defiant demands for men’s lives. It was
said he remained at home from fear of assassination. Charlotte
Corday resolved to seek him in his home.</p>

<p>She wrote this letter:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I have just arrived from Caen. Your patriotism allows
me to be presumptive enough to hope that you will hear
privately what I have to say concerning events in that city.
I shall present myself at your door about one o’clock. I
pray you for the good of all France—receive me!”</p>
</div>

<p>She went to his house, and was refused admittance. She
wrote another letter:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I cannot believe that it was you yourself refused me admission:
you are too good a patriot. I repeat, I have important
news to tell you; that I have just arrived from the
north, and I have secrets to disclose. I am persecuted.
Will <em>you</em>, then, not aid me?”</p>
</div>

<p>At seven the next morning she dressed herself very carefully.
She wore a white dress, with a silk scarf crossed over
the breast and knotted behind—a white Normandy cap,
bound with a green ribbon—her hair falling over her shoulders.
Her face was bright, fresh-colored, her countenance
smiling.</p>

<p>Thus she presented herself at the house occupied by
Marat, who happened to be in his bath, which he used, not
for its cleanly offices, but because it reduced the bodily
inflammation which had now become habitual to him.</p>

<p>The house, which bore all the aspects of that poverty in
which Marat was really plunged, was jealously guarded.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_341"></a>[341]</span>
But what men could suspect a beautiful girl, clothed in
brilliant white, her face flushing with youth and beauty?</p>

<p>Charlotte Corday stepped from her coach, and approached
the house. She reached the outer door of the apartments
in which Marat lived, and there her entrance was jealously
opposed by Albertine, Marat’s mistress, and a female friend.</p>

<p>Marat, hearing the altercation, and associating the pleading
voice with the letters he had received, imperatively
ordered the applicant to be admitted.</p>

<p>Now mark what occurred. The woman Albertine, offended,
walked away, her friend followed her, and Charlotte
Corday was alone with Marat.</p>

<p>The room was dark, close, and smelt abominably. He
was wrapped in a dirty sheet, and sitting in a bath, across
which was a rough piece of wood which he made his desk,
for he passed hours in the water. He was writing when
Charlotte Corday entered. He had finished this sentence:—“I
demand that every man in France who has the blood
of the Bourbons in his veins, however little, shall be put
upon his trial, and his wife and children also.”</p>

<p>She approached this human monster, her eyes downcast.
He spoke to her imperiously—“What is the state of Normandy?”</p>

<p>“Certain deputies have taken refuge in Caen.”</p>

<p>“Their names?”</p>

<p>She gave certain names, and he wrote them down.</p>

<p>“Good!” he said; “before another week is past, they
shall be guillotined.”</p>

<p>At this moment she raised the dagger she took from the
breast of her dress, and plunged it down into his bosom.</p>

<p>“Help, my dear, help!” he cried, and fell back dead.</p>

<p>Albertine, the woman, and a man named Basse rushed
forward in time to see his last-drawn breath. By this time
the water was like that crimson stream Marat was for ever
demanding. He was bathed in it himself now.</p>

<p>She did not attempt to escape. She drew out the dagger,
let it fall, and took two or three steps to the window. The
man Basse caught up a chair and beat her down, whereupon
the woman, Albertine, trampled upon her.</p>

<p>The news spread in an incalculably short space of time,
and the seething people called up into the air, “Throw her
out to us; we are waiting.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_342"></a>[342]</span></p>

<p>Soldiers rushed in, forming a hedge of steel about Charlotte
Corday, and beat back the blaspheming crowd.</p>

<p>Charlotte showed no fear, crossed her hands ready for the
cords, and her first words were “Poor woman!” in reference
to Albertine, who was rending the air with her cries.</p>

<p>She said afterwards she had not asked herself the question,
“Could this man be loved?”</p>

<p>“Poor people!” she said to those who endeavored to tear
her to pieces; “you desire my death, whilst you owe me an
altar for having freed you from a monster! Oh, throw me
to the people,” she said to the soldiers; “as they regret
him, they are fit to be my executioners!”</p>

<p>She was not cast among the people—at least, she died in
peace. She boasted of her act, and declared herself a martyr.</p>

<p>Paris turned pale at the news. The panic reaching the
Convention, business was arrested. One Henriot, the
Commandant-General of the National Guard, entered.</p>

<p>“Tremble!” he cried. “Marat has been assassinated by
a girl, who boasts of her deed! Tremble! Such a fate
threatens all! Mistrust green ribbons, and let us swear to
avenge the death of this great man.”</p>

<p>Charlotte Corday, accused of murder, stood beautiful and
smiling in the midst of accusers, all of whom wore fierce
looks of hate and rage.</p>

<p>She was fearless until she reached the street, when the
blaze of shouts so terrified this young country girl, that she
fainted. Restored to consciousness, (they had bound her
weak hands), she cried, “Alas! do I still live?”</p>

<p>Then quite consistently, she thanked her guardians for
saving her from the crowd.</p>

<p>She never for one moment looked upon her act as a crime.
When interrogated at her trial, she adhered to this statement:—“I
saw civil war enveloping France. I considered
Marat its chief cause, and to save my country I sacrificed
myself, and slew him.”</p>

<p>That her virtue was attacked at her trial, is a condition
of things which clearly proves how deeply dyed in prejudice
by this time had become the revolutionary tribunals.</p>

<p>One Chabot under pretence of suspecting a concealed
paper, tore off her breast kerchief. She leaped back at the
outrage, the string of her dress broke, and her fair chest<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_343"></a>[343]</span>
was exposed to the gaze of a number of savage men. Her
hands were corded, so that she could not save herself from
degradation; and her virtue gave of itself her best proof,
for she crouched down to hide her disarranged dress. Entreating
them to untie her hands, they complied; and turning
her back to the wall, she rapidly completed her toilette.
Where the cords had been, the flesh was marked with great
blue bands; and very meekly she asked to be allowed to
put on her long gloves before the knots were again tied.
Upon her dress, after her death, was found pinned a long
address to France, in which she entreated all men to destroy
the Jacobins, and save France.</p>

<p>She was condemned to die the following morning. An
artist, during her trial, having been remarked by her drawing
her face, she requested he might complete it, and the
painter was introduced to her cell. One man endeavored
to save her by maintaining she was insane. In this shape
of pity, he nearly lost his own head.</p>

<p>She wrote of Marat finally:—“Pardon me, oh men!
The name of Marat dishonors your race. He was a beast
of prey seeking to devour France by war and hate. I
thank Heaven that by birth he was no Frenchman.”</p>

<p>She was pained by the accusation made by Chabot, the
wretch who had torn away her neckerchief, who declared
she had been his mistress, far more than by the thought of
approaching death. “Chabot,” she wrote, “is a mere madman.
I never even dreamed of this man. He need not be
feared—he has not intellect enough to be dangerous.”</p>

<p>In the same paper she said, “All Parisians are such
good citizens, they cannot comprehend how a useless
woman, whose longest term of life would be good for nothing,
can calmly sacrifice herself for her country. To-morrow,
at twelve, <em>I shall have lived!</em>”</p>

<p>Again she said, “’Tis crime gives the shame—it is not
the block.” This is the verse of the great French poet
Corneille, who was her ancestor.</p>

<p>Tried at eight in the morning, and knowing she should
die at mid-day, she said, upon leaving the prison, “Madame
Richard, pray let my breakfast be ready upon my return,
or we shall not have time to take it together.”</p>

<p>At her trial, it being maintained that the nature of the
blow which killed Marat had been that of one accomplished<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_344"></a>[344]</span>
in the use of the dagger, she cried, “Miserable wretch—he
takes me for an assassin!”</p>

<p>The counsel for her defence urged that she only pleaded
that in killing Marat she was doing a public good.</p>

<p>The jury directly found her guilty, and ordered her property
to be confiscated.</p>

<p>“Sir,” she said to her defender, “you have done well.
But I cannot pay you, for you have heard how my property
has been seized. However, I do you this honor; I pray
that you will pay the few pieces of silver I owe to the
prison people—they ought to be paid.”</p>

<p>Going back to her prison, where the painter finished her
portrait, she conversed about painting.</p>

<p>A knock at the cell-door, and the executioner entered,
carrying scissors with which to cut away her hair, and the
red garments worn by the condemned on their way to execution.</p>

<p>“Sir,” she said to the painter, “I can only offer you a
lock of hair.”</p>

<p>And taking the gaoler’s scissors, she cut a lock of the
wonderful hair.</p>

<p>A priest coming, she said, “I thank those who have
been kind enough to send you, but I do not require your
services. The blood I have spilt, and my own, which I am
about to shed, are the only sacrifices I can offer the Eternal.”</p>

<p>The executioner now cut off her hair, and flung over her
head the red garment.</p>

<p>“This,” she said, “is the toilette of death, arranged by
somewhat rude hands, but it leads to immortality.”</p>

<p>As she stepped upon the cart, such as carried all those
condemned to death to the place of execution, a violent
storm burst over Paris. Women danced about the death-cart,
uttering imprecations; hers was the only calm face to
be seen. Strangely enough, the rain wetting the red flannel—her
only covering to the waist—it clung to her skin,
and betrayed her to be exquisitely formed, especially as her
hands were so tied behind her that she was forced to hold
herself upright.</p>

<p>As she neared the scaffold, the sun appeared, and the
gold threads in her hair shone out magnificently.</p>

<p>The leaders of the rebellion, Danton, Robespierre,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_345"></a>[345]</span>
Camille Desmoulins, standing at a window, saw her pass.
She had preserved them from Marat, but, at the same time,
she had shown how a tyrant could be slain. She saved
their lives by her act; but she taught, also, how they
might be taken.</p>

<p>One Adam Lux, a German, was hopelessly stricken by
love as she passed along. He followed to the scaffold’s feet,
asking to die with her.</p>

<p>Reaching the scaffold, she turned pale, and, for one
moment, shrank; but the next, recovering herself, ascended
the steps as rapidly as her long red dress and pinioned arms
would allow.</p>

<p>When the executioner pulled down her dress, that her
neck might be bare, she was for the last time outraged
while living. She placed herself upon the plank, and, the
next moment, her head fell.</p>

<p>Legros, a miserable scaffold-dog, took up the head by the
remaining hair, and struck at the cheeks. It is said the
skin grew scarlet, as though the modesty of Charlotte Corday
outlasted her life.</p>

<p>Did her face change color? Some hold that the head
has consciousness and power after being severed from the
body, and that it can see and hear. Nay, it was urged during
the Revolution that the passion of the heads remained,
because the interior of the wicker baskets in which the
heads were carried away were often found to be gnawed, as
though the teeth of the heads gnashed after separation
from the body. For my part, I believe that this gnawing
was effected by rats, which at that time, even more than
now, overran Paris.</p>

<p>Such was the death of Marat—of his murderer, whom we
cannot praise. But who can blame her? Assuredly her
death was necessary to purge her of assassination, to some
extent.</p>

<p>Adam Lux, wild with love, published a defence of
Charlotte Corday. He was seized, and, three days afterwards,
died by the very knife which destroyed her life.</p>

<p>Chénier, the patriotic poet, sang her heroism. He was
soon arrested, and therefore beheaded.</p>

<p>But what good had Charlotte Corday done?</p>

<p>She had strengthened the love of the people for desperate
measures; she had made a martyr of their most foul leader.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_346"></a>[346]</span>
She gave a dignity to those who advocated the scaffold.
The liberal twenty-two knew that this last act annihilated
them.</p>

<span class="fs70 lsp2">MARIE ANTOINETTE.</span></h2>


<p>The Convention ordained the <em>worship</em> of Marat, and
cast his corpse to the people as an idol.</p>

<p>He was called Cæsar, and his funeral was modelled upon
the historical narrative of that given by Rome to the great
Julius.</p>

<p>The body was carried by torchlight to the garden of the
house in which he made his most inflammatory speeches;
and there he was buried under trees heavily laden with
countless brilliantly-illuminated paper lamps.</p>

<p>His head was placed in an urn, and hung in the centre
of the Convention. His memory was decreed an altar, and
at its foot his admirers appropriately called for blood.</p>

<p>The enemy was now approaching on all sides, and thousands
more Royalists were in array.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Danton was sinking in estimation, Robespierre
rising, for Robespierre was a patient man.</p>

<p>Danton, dazzled with his new wife, wished to live the life
of a small country gentleman. It was too late.</p>

<p>Robespierre was breaking in health, but his temperance
would stand him in good stead of health for a long while.
His motto was “Wait.”</p>

<p>The Committee of Public Safety was meanwhile reaping
a rich harvest of death.</p>

<p>Money was no longer to be seen.</p>

<p>Bread was rare.</p>

<p>People were dying of starvation (especially the old) in
every street.</p>

<p>The more cruel of the Conventionists carried by acclamation
these decrees—the true legal inauguration of the
Reign of Terror:</p>

<p>“Six thousand soldiers and twelve hundred artillerymen<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_347"></a>[347]</span>
to do blindly the bidding of the Committee of Public
Safety.</p>

<p>“All men who have been in the Government occupation
during the late King’s life, to quit Paris.</p>

<p>“The delivery of the Revolutionary Tribunal of the
Moderate Conventionists.</p>

<p>“The right to search any house at any hour of the night.</p>

<p>“The transportation beyond the seas of every common
woman in the land.</p>

<p>“Finally, the payment of workmen who should leave
their shops to follow up the public service.”</p>

<p>By these measures the mob were not only encouraged to
take life, but paid to do it. Nothing could save such a system
resulting, if long continued, in national death!</p>

<p>By the way, <em>Sunday</em> was chosen as the best day for
working these mob committees.</p>

<p>This was followed by Merlin’s decree, which provided for
the arrest (without proof) of any suspected person, and of
all those who, not working, were enabled to live in a better
condition than one of penury. This was an attack upon all
people who had hidden money. In fact, starvation had by
this time become the only mode of avoiding the guillotine.</p>

<p>Prisons were not large enough to contain prisoners, and
all the confiscated churches were converted into gaols.
Death was decreed for almost every act of life—certainly for
every act of pity.</p>

<p>A hundred men, less two, were beheaded in sixty days in
Paris alone.</p>

<p>The Queen was too noble a victim to escape.</p>

<p>The Convention suddenly ordered her trial, and commanded
her separation from the two children.</p>

<p>Now all the lethargy which has possessed her since the
King’s death departs, and she becomes as a lioness fighting
for her young.</p>

<p>By this time, all the beauty of Marie Antoinette had
vanished, and there remained a very broken old woman,
aged about a little more than thirty, with very scanty
white hair, falling in patches from an almost bald head.
The body, as the soul, had shrunken—a skeleton remained,
covered with mere skin.</p>

<p>This was the Queen, who leapt into life when her dulled
hearing comprehended that she was to be separated from her<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_348"></a>[348]</span>
children. They had but the mercy only to remove the
son.</p>

<p>The boy clung to his mother, who lost all dignity, dug
her nails into the child’s flesh, and called upon the men to
kill them both.</p>

<p>For two hours this lasted, and then she became a woman
again—a mother; and dressing him to look as smart as
possible, she gave him up with her own hands to his gaoler,
Simon, who took him at once to the room where the child
was destined to die. For two days and nights the child
lay upon the floor, taking neither food nor drink.</p>

<p>The Queen never took her son in her arms. He was to
outlive her but a little time, and then die of sheer ill-usage
and neglect.</p>

<p>The Queen, however, still had her husband’s sister and
her daughter with her. The only consolation they had,
was ascending to the platform of their tower, to catch a
glimpse of the boy on the platform of the other tower.</p>

<p>Simon’s work it was to deprave the body and soul of the
wretched child. He forced him to drink strong wine, and
made him answer to the name of “Wolf.” He beat him if
he wept, encouraged him to every possible disgusting act,
and compelled him to sing obscene songs, while he (his
master) smoked and drank.</p>

<p>Once, he nearly destroyed one of the poor Prince’s eyes;
at another, he raised a poker against him. Sometimes he
was kind; and, upon one occasion, he said, “Capet, if the
soldiers come and deliver you, what will you do?”</p>

<p>“Forgive you,” said the child.</p>

<p>The man Simon actually wept, but he cried immediately
afterwards, “There’s some of the blood of the lion in the
whelp.”</p>

<p>In the middle of the night of the 2nd of August, the
Queen was awakened, and told she was to be removed <em>alone</em>,
to another prison.</p>

<p>In vain the women threw themselves at the feet of the
men. They had but their duty to do.</p>

<p>The Queen was compelled to dress before them, while
they ransacked the room, and seized every little object the
Queen still retained. The miserable creatures left her a
handkerchief.</p>

<p>And now, exactly as Louis XVI had told his children to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_349"></a>[349]</span>
forgive their enemies, so now desolate Marie Antoinette
told her daughter, in her last words to the poor child, to
forgive those who parted them.</p>

<p>“I give my children to you, sister. Be a second mother
to them.”</p>

<p>For precisely as Louis appears to have had no conception
of the monstrosity of putting a woman to death, so the
Queen, in leaving the Temple, appears not to have supposed
for one moment that the Princess Elizabeth would be
claimed by the scaffold,—she who had led the life of a true
woman, who had nursed and helped the people, and never
joined in the frivolities of the Court.</p>

<p>The Queen was taken to the prison of the Conciergerie,
which is composed of the dungeons below high water mark,
to be found amongst the foundations of the Palace of
Justice.</p>

<p>To a wretched cell, having in one corner a straw bed, and
by the light of one candle, was the ex-Queen taken.</p>

<p>A woman desirous of death in the dungeon of a stronghold,
and yet they only believed her safe when two soldiers,
swords drawn, stood at the outer door watching, with orders
not to lose sight of the Widow Capet, even when asleep.</p>

<p>Madam Richard, that good woman who tended Charlotte
Corday in her last moments, was the Queen’s most humane
gaoler. She found something like furniture for the cell,
procured wholesome food for the captive, and often brought
a low-whispered message from the royal prisoners still in
the Temple.</p>

<p>A little while, and the dampness of the cell rotted the
Queen’s only dresses—two very common ones; and her
underclothing becoming in tatters, she was half naked.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_LIX">CHAPTER LIX.<br>
<span class="fs70">MARIE ANTOINETTE FINDS PEACE AT LAST.</span></h2>


<p>Marie Antoinette in her last prison, however, was
not without pitying friends. The fierce communists ordered
that she should drink the water of the Seine, drawn as it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_350"></a>[350]</span>
flowed past her prison-walls; but an honest couple, named
Bault, obtained the posts of chief gaolers at the Conciergerie,
in the full aim of assuaging the Queen’s wretchedness.
Instead of Seine water, the poor prisoner found daily in
her cell refreshing draughts of water drawn from that well
at Versailles which was the Queen’s chief cellar. She was
a great water drinker.</p>

<p>Madame Bault, to affect harshness, never entered the
Princess’s cell, asserting that to do so was to be contaminated.
The royal tradespeople of former days—especially
the fruit-women—brought little offerings secretly; and so
it came about that the Queen, in her last prison and days,
ate such pure, simple meals as those which had been her
favorite food in the old days—a piece of melon, a handful
of figs, a little bread and a glass of water from her favorite
well.</p>

<p>The two gowns which the Queen possessed—one white,
the other black,—and which she wore alternately, soon fell
to pieces in the damp prison. Her underclothing was
always damp when put on, and often her shoes would be
completely wet; for between her and the river there was
only the part protection of a wall.</p>

<p>Human nature demands some work. Not allowed writing
or sewing materials (Bault’s daughter mended the Queen’s
tatters, and gave away the little fragments which she cut
away in the process as relics of the poor lady), with a pin
she scratched her thoughts upon the driest portion of the
walls of her prison. After her death many of these sentences
were copied by one of the commissioners. They
were mostly German and Italian verses bearing reference
to her fate, and little Latin verses from the Psalms. No
French did she use, for she had been brought into the land
where that language was spoken to be cast into prison, and
to suffer death. The drier walls were covered with these
mute appeals.</p>

<p>Some idea may be gained of the cruelty exercised
towards the desolate prisoner, when she, asking for a lighter
coverlet, and Bault forwarding the request to a high authority,
the latter received this reply:—</p>

<p>“Take care! Another sign of sympathy such as that,
and you will visit the guillotine before she does!”</p>

<p>Another shape of industry did the poor Queen find. She<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_351"></a>[351]</span>
wished to leave her daughter a memento of her last days,
and she had nothing to give; so she converted a couple of
bone toothpicks into knitting needles, pulled some worsted
shreds from the heavy old coverlet which they refused to
replace with a lighter, and knitted a—garter. This she,
dropped near the friendly Bault, who, with the heart of a
father, understanding the poor little bit of workmanship,
let fall his handkerchief, and so possessed himself of the
little treasure. After her death the tribute reached the
young Princess for whom it was worked—truly a message
from the grave.</p>

<p>A few days before her trial, an order, possessed by something
of mercy, arrived, by force of which she was relieved
from the continuous stare of the guard set to watch her.
By this relief, she was enabled to kneel, from which act she
had been warned throughout her confinement.</p>

<p>On October 13th, Fouquier-Tinville notified to Marie
Antoinette the fact of her having been indicted for high
treason.</p>

<p>She listened to the reading of the indictment as though
to a death-warrant—the shape, in fact, it really took.</p>

<p>As a matter of form, she chose two counsel for her defence—men
who had secretly sought the appointment, and
who, afterwards, of course, paid for their pity with their
lives.</p>

<p>On the 14th, at noon, she made as elegant a toilette as
she could—hid the rags and the patchiness of her white
hair as much as possible, and went up the stone stairs of
her dungeon to the judgment-hall above her prison. The
passages were full of people, who reviled her as she passed
along. She bore her head well up, but she could not
change the fallen mouth, the pinched nose, tarnished eyes,
and shrunken, weakened body. But the black circles
round those eyes artificially increased their failing brilliancy,
and they fired glances of scorn and fearlessness at her
gibing enemies. She had never possessed the humble,
religious feeling and sweet patience which distinguished
Louis. A perfectly pure woman, at heart, she was somewhat
of a Voltairean; she despised death, and feared no
power. We are as we are made; so, in her final trial, she
met the scowls of the people, chiefly of women, face to face.
Some authorities say that one girl uttered a cry of pity as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_352"></a>[352]</span>
the Queen passed—she was strangled. These unsexed
wretches had undertaken to accompany the Queen to the
scaffold with every possible indignity.</p>

<p>And she stands before her—judges.</p>

<p>“What is your name?”</p>

<p>“I am called Marie Antoinette, of Lorraine, in Austria,”
she replies, in a low, musical voice.</p>

<p>“Your condition?”</p>

<p>“Widow of Louis, formerly King of the French.”</p>

<p>“Your age?”</p>

<p>“Thirty-seven.”</p>

<p>Louquier-Tinville now read the indictment. It was the
summing up of all her declared crimes of high birth, condition,
and rank. She was quite guilty of all these things.
The chief accusations were merely echoes of all that had
been whispered of her in the foulest places. She was
accused of prodigality, licentiousness, and treason to
France.</p>

<p>She showed no sign of emotion, beyond an unheeded
movement of the fingers over the bar of a chair, as though
they were recalling some half-forgotten music.</p>

<p>She answered all questions quite patiently, showed sorrow
only when reference was made to the Princess de Lamballe,
and only lost her quietude when one Hébert was called.
It is to be hoped this man was mad. At all events, he
spoke to the Queen’s acts while in the Temple; declared
that she was depraved and debauched, and that she had
even corrupted her own son, “that she might poison his
body and his soul, and so reign in his name over the ruin
of his understanding.”</p>

<p>This man was mad—there can be no doubt upon the
point: he even included saintly Madame Elizabeth in this
frantic idiotic accusation.</p>

<p>Heaven be thanked, those present turned upon him, and
cried “Shame!” The Queen herself shrank, raising her
hand as though to guard her from the wretch.</p>

<p>But one juryman was nearly as bad as Hébert.</p>

<p>“Why does not the accused answer?” this foul wretch
asked.</p>

<p>“I do not answer,” she said—and once again, it is said,
she looked radiantly beautiful in her momentary indignation—“because
these are accusations to which nature refuses
a reply.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_353"></a>[353]</span></p>

<p>She turned to the women, with whom the court was
crowded.</p>

<p>“I appeal from him to all mothers present.”</p>

<p>To the honor of these women be it said, they cried Hébert
down—and so he passes out of this history.</p>

<p>The Queen met questions having reference to the King
with equal calmness. It being alleged that she endeavored
to obtain ascendancy over him through his mental weakness,
she replied, “I never knew that character of him. I
was but his wife, and it was my duty and my pleasure to
yield to his will.”</p>

<p>By not one word, tending to save herself, did she injure
the memory of her husband.</p>

<p>One line in the trial is enough to show what a mockery
it was.</p>

<p>The Public Prosecutor cried, “All France bears witness
against this woman!”</p>

<p>For form’s sake, the jury deliberated an hour. She was
recalled to hear her sentence, but the cheering and screaming
of the people told her its terrors before the judge spoke—<em>death!</em></p>

<p>Nine months since the King died, and now there was an
end to her weary waiting.</p>

<p>Asked if she had anything to say why the sentence of
death should not be carried out, she respected herself in
her very silence, and turned away, as though quite prepared
for execution.</p>

<p>It was now five in the morning, and her last day was
come. At half-past five she was permitted to write a letter
to the King’s sister, Madame Elizabeth. This lady never
saw it. The document was found long afterwards amongst
the papers of one Couthon.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I write to you, my sister,” she begins, “for the last
time. I have been condemned, not to an ignominious
death—that only awaits criminals—but to go and rejoin
your brother. Innocent as he, I hope to show such firmness
as the King’s in his last moments. I grieve bitterly
at leaving my poor children. You know that I lived but
for them and you—you who, in your love, have sacrificed
all for us. I learnt, at my trial, that you are separated
from my little girl. In what a position I leave you! I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_354"></a>[354]</span>
dare not write to her; they would not give her my letter,
and, indeed, I do not know that you will receive this.”</p>
</div>

<p>Some words of this final letter are inexpressibly touching.
“Let my son never forget his father’s last words. <em>Let him
never seek to avenge our deaths!</em>”</p>

<p>She then goes on to apologize for the child’s possible conduct
to her, after the influence over him necessarily obtained
by Simon, his tutor, and meekly she urges that he is so
young he is incapable of knowing what he does.</p>

<p>“Think of me always,” she says, in conclusion. “Good
heaven, and my children! How heart-rending it is to
leave them for ever—for ever!”</p>

<p>This letter being finished, she kissed each page lovingly,
and folded it.</p>

<p>So far, the Republic had not entirely declared against
high heaven, and priests were still recognised by those who
had subscribed to the articles of the Revolution, and one of
these men was offered to Marie Antoinette to aid her in her
last moments. She refused to see him. The Convention
(still sitting) insisted upon one of these officials accompanying
her to the scaffold. There was no devotion amongst
them. All hesitated, for all feared that the Queen would
be torn to pieces on her way to the scaffold.</p>

<p>One proffered his help.</p>

<p>“Thank you,” said the Queen; “I have no need of
your services, though I am a great sinner. But I am about
to receive a great sacrament.”</p>

<p>“Martyrdom,” said the priest, in a low voice; and he
bowed and retired.</p>

<p>She prayed alone.</p>

<p>However, she had been secretly informed that at a certain
house on her way to execution a minister would be
stationed, who would give her absolution as she passed in
the cart.</p>

<p>She dressed herself in the white gown, put a white cap
on, bound with a black ribbon—and so came before the people.</p>

<p>Then she drew back—her queendom still remained. She
had not thought the people so fallen that she should be
taken to the scaffold in the common cart. The King had
been taken to death at least in such a vehicle as he had
been accustomed to.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_355"></a>[355]</span></p>

<p>Alas! When Louis died all pity had expired; with her
death, all France was to gasp with thirst for blood.</p>

<p>She mounted the cart—her hands having been bound behind
her, and in the midst of a raging crowd. The cart
swayed, and she could scarcely keep her seat on the plank.</p>

<p>She grew red and pale by turns, as she was dragged
through the mob. The patience and pity exhibited by the
King she could not imitate. Her lips were bitter each
moment; but she never took her dry, hot eyes from the
raging people.</p>

<p>Suddenly, her head falls humbly, and, her hands being
tied, she makes the sign of the cross by three motions of
the head.</p>

<p>Her pride had passed with that unseen blessing from
the house on her way to execution. When the Palace of
the Tuileries came in view—the place where she had spent
nearly half her life—tears fell down her face.</p>

<p>A few turns of the wheels, and she was at the foot of the
scaffold.</p>

<p>Reaching the place, accidentally she trod upon one of the
executioners’ feet.</p>

<p>“Pardon me,” she said, in a sweet, courtly voice.</p>

<p>She knelt for an instant, rose, stretched her neck towards
the distant towers of the Temple, and cried, “Good-bye,
my children! I am going to your father.”</p>

<p>She did not, like her husband, speed to Heaven. It was
rather that she fled from earth.</p>

<p>The executioner was trembling more than his victim, so
that she suffered a long agony of a few moments after she
was upon the plank.</p>

<p>The assistant executioner took his brother’s place.</p>

<p>The head fell. It was taken up and carried around the
scaffold.</p>

<p>“<em>Long live the Republic!</em>” saluted this brave display.</p>

<p>The Revolution thought itself avenged—it was befouled.</p>

<p>She came a foreigner—and they killed her.</p>

<p>Thus she died. Frivolous in prosperity, she died with
intrepidity. Her misfortune was her mistrust of the people
in her early days—her catastrophe, that all the sin and
wickedness of the Court was laid to her account.</p>

<p>Called upon to fill a throne, those who called her gave her
not even a tomb—for you may read in a parish register,
“<cite>For the coffin of the Widow Capet, six shillings!</cite>”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_356"></a>[356]</span></p>

<p>With her life, France threw away all Christian mercy.
Crimson swept over the breadth and length of the land.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_LX">CHAPTER LX.<br>
<span class="fs70 lsp2">THE TWENTY-TWO.</span></h2>


<p>The twenty-two had literally been under the control of
the police, though not arrested, since May 31st. But as
events progressed, their destruction became almost necessary
to the safety of those members of the Convention, who,
obtaining power wholly through the will of the more
violent, could only retain it by a perfect recognition of the
will of those who had given them the victory.</p>

<p>The twenty-two were therefore seized, and placed in a
building converted from a convent into a prison, and here
they made full preparations to die.</p>

<p>To this day, the walls of this place may be seen covered
with mementoes of the prison-days of the victims of the
Revolution. They are chiefly short verses, written in
blood, the purple hues of which many of the inscriptions
still retain.</p>

<p>A few days after the Queen’s day of peace arrived, their
trial commenced.</p>

<p>Of what were they accused?</p>

<p>Really, nothing; but they were in the way, and a threatening
division of the masses insisted upon their death.</p>

<p>After four days’ mockery of justice, the twenty-two were
declared guilty of having conspired against the unity and
indivisibility of the republic, and the whole were condemned
to die.</p>

<p>A cry of horror burst from the condemned, for many of
them could not believe that innocent men could be sent to
the scaffold.</p>

<p>Valasé, one of the youngest, slipped from his seat to the
floor.</p>

<p>“What, Valasé! art losing courage now?” cried his
friend Brissot, upholding him.</p>

<p>“No; I am dying!” returned Valasé; and his fingers<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_357"></a>[357]</span>
quivered about the handle of the poniard with which he
had taken his own life.</p>

<p>Silent horror for a moment prevailed; the Girondists
blushed and bowed their heads before their dead companion,
who had given them an example of fearlessness in
meeting death.</p>

<p>Only one, named Boileau, showed cowardice. He cast
his hat into the air and screamed, “I don’t belong to these
men! I am a Jacobin!”</p>

<p>But instead of pity he only gained contempt.</p>

<p>And now a cry was heard; it came from Camille Desmoulins:
“Let me fly,” he cried; “it is my book which
has killed them!”</p>

<p>But the crowd seized Desmoulins, and forced him to remain.</p>

<p>The twenty-two came down from the high seats upon
which they had heard their trial and sentence, and for a
moment stood round the dead body of their friend, who had
shown them how to die. Almost simultaneously they
raised their hands and cried, “Innocent! Long live the
republic!”</p>

<p>Then they cast all the money they had with them
amongst the crowding, storming people, who greedily seized
it. This was done, not to excite the mob to revolt, but
with the thought that, their death at hand, they had no
farther need of wealth.</p>

<p>There was something strangely classic and Roman-like
in their death. They left the hall singing loudly the celebrated
hymn, the “Marseillaise;” and in reference to
their death, they sang with amazing power the celebrated
two lines,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indentq">“March on, march on! O children of the land,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The day, the hour of glory, is at hand!”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>This terrible hymn they were still singing as they entered
their prison. It was now late in the evening, and they
were to suffer on the following morning.</p>

<p>The tribunal had decreed that the yet warm corpse of
Valasé should be carried back to prison, conveyed in the
same cart with his accomplices to the scaffold, and interred
with their bodies. The only sentence, perhaps, which punished
the dead.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_358"></a>[358]</span></p>

<p>Four men-at-arms carried the body upon a litter, and
thus the procession reached the prison.</p>

<p>The twenty-two were to pass the night in the same
room, the corpse in one corner. The twenty-one—even
Boileau, who repented of his momentary cowardice—came,
one by one, and kissed the dead man’s hand, then covered
his face, saying, “To-morrow, brother!”</p>

<p>One Bailleul, a Girondist and a Conventionist, but who
had escaped the proscription, yet had not left Paris, had
promised that, after the trial, he would prepare and send to
the prison, either a triumphant or a funereal supper, according
to the sentence.</p>

<p>The promise was kept. Upon the oaken table, stretching
the length of their dungeon was set out a supper, royal
in its magnificence. Every luxury to be obtained, every
delicate wine with a name, filled those portions of the
table not covered by a wealth of flowers and great clusters
of brilliantly burning wax candles.</p>

<p>To one Abbé Lambert, who lived fifty years after that
night, we owe all we have learnt concerning that final meal.
This minister was waiting to offer consolation to the condemned
as they passed to the scaffold.</p>

<p>The supper lasted from midnight until the dawn of day—at
the end of October, about half-past five. It was the
feast of their marriage with death. No sign was given of
their approaching end. All ate with sobriety, but with
appetite; and it was only when the fruit and wine alone
remained on the table that the conversation became excited
and powerful.</p>

<p>Many, especially the younger men, who did not leave
families behind them, were very gay and witty. They
had done no great wrong, and were sacrificed to duty,
therefore they met death with cheerful faces.</p>

<p>With solemn break of day, the conversation became
graver.</p>

<p>Brissot cried, “now that we, the honest men amongst
those who govern, are about to die, what will become of the
republic? How much blood will it require to wash away
the memory of ours?”</p>

<p>“Friends,” cried Vergniaud, “we have killed the tree
by over-pruning it. It was aged—Robespierre cuts it
down. Will he be more fortunate than ourselves? No;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_359"></a>[359]</span>
the land of France is now too weak for honest growth.
The people play with laws as children with toys; they are
too weak to govern themselves; and they will return to
their kings as children to their toys, after they are tired of
having thrown them away. We thought ourselves at
Rome; we were in Paris. But, in dying, let us leave to
the whole of France—the strength of hope. Some day—some
great day—she will be able to govern herself.”</p>

<p>At ten o’clock the executioners arrived to prepare the
victims for the scaffold. Gensomé, picking up a lock of the
black, brilliant hair cut from his head, gave it to Abbé
Lambert, and begged him to carry it to his wife. “Tell
her,” he said, “it is all I can send, and that I die thinking
of her.”</p>

<p>Vergniaud drew his watch from his pocket, scratched his
initials and the date in it with a pin, and sent it by the
hands of one of the executioners’ assistants to a young girl
whom he loved deeply, and whom it is said he intended to
marry.</p>

<p>Every one sent a something to some one or more in memory
of himself, and it is pleasant to be able to state that
every message and remembrance were faithfully delivered.</p>

<p>When the last lock of hair had fallen, the victims were
marshalled, and they were led out to the carts waiting to
receive them.</p>

<p>They sang the “Marseillaise” to the scaffold—they sang
it when they reached it, the song growing fainter and
fainter as each head fell; and the hymn only ceased, as the
last head fell—that of their leader, Vergniaud.</p>

<p>The dead body of their friend was carried with them.</p>

<p>Such was the end of the founders of the French republic.</p>

<p>With them the brightness, beauty, youth, wit, frankness
of the Convention passed away, and their places were filled
by sullen, threatening men.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_LXI">CHAPTER LXI.<br>
<span class="fs70">THE RED FLAG.</span></h2>


<p>The first to fall was the Duc of Orleans (father of Louis
Philippe, King of the French). He had done nothing
against the interests of the republic, but his birth was a
crime, and his death was decided on.</p>

<p>The Prince and his sons were at table when the fatal
indictment arrived.</p>

<p>“So much the better,” said he. “This must end one
way or the other. Kiss me, children. And I wonder of
what they accuse me?” he said, opening the paper. “The
scoundrels!” he added; “they accuse me of nothing.
Come, boys, eat; for this summons is indeed good news.”</p>

<p>He was taken to Paris, where, at this time, no man of
mark, being put upon his trial, escaped the guillotine.</p>

<p>The one plausible accusation brought against Orleans
must have compressed his heart.</p>

<p>“Did you not vote the King’s death in the hope of succeeding
to his throne?”</p>

<p>“No; I obeyed my heart and my conscience.”</p>

<p>He heard his sentence calmly, despite the fact of his
cowardice in his early years; and he replied sarcastically to
his judges, “Since you were determined to condemn me,
you should have found better pretexts than you have; for,
as it is, you will deceive no man into believing that you
think me guilty. I am in the way. And you too,” he
said, turning to a once Marquis d’Autonelle, an old friend,—“you
to condemn me! Finally,” he continued, “since I
am to die, I demand not to be left in gaol a whole night,
but to be at once taken to the block.”</p>

<p>This desire was not complied with. Returning to the
gaol, his rage was terrible.</p>

<p>The Abbé Lambert approached and said, “Citizen
Equality, will you accept my assistance, or, at least, the
offer of my condolence?”</p>

<p>“Who are you?”</p>

<p>“The Vicar-General of the Bishop of Paris. If you
will not accept my religious help, can I be of any service to
you after your death? Have you messages to send?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_361"></a>[361]</span></p>

<p>“No; I can die without help, and like a good citizen.”</p>

<p>He went to the place of execution at three, accompanied
by three others.</p>

<p>Reaching the scaffold, he looked at the knife calmly;
and the executioner offering to remove his boots, he said,
“You will do it more easily afterwards.”</p>

<p>He was dressed very beautifully for his death, and he
died without fear. He had followed the Revolution blindly—had
thrown away fortune, name, reputation, in its cause,
and it destroyed him simply because he had belonged to
royalty.</p>

<p>Terror was rapidly reddening all the land.</p>

<p>The guillotine was not quick enough, and squads of
soldiers shot down the condemned.</p>

<p>Such sentences as the following, were accepted as
truths:—</p>

<p>“The time is come when the prophecy shall be fulfilled.
The wealthy shall be despoiled, and the poor shall be
enriched.</p>

<p>“If the people want bread, let them profit by the sight
of their misery, to seize on the possessions of the wealthy.</p>

<p>“Do you seek a word which furnishes all you need?—die,
or cause others to die.”</p>

<p>The great Terror began at Lyons.</p>

<p>“The great day of vengeance has arrived,” cried one
Cholier. “Five hundred men amongst us deserve to share
the fate of the tyrant. I will give you the list—be it your
part to strike!”</p>

<p>He then seized a crucifix, dashed it upon the ground,
and trampled upon it.</p>

<p>Here is another theory which was applauded:—</p>

<p>“Any man can be an executioner—it is the guillotine
which really takes life.”</p>

<p>This Cholier, who had trampled upon the crucifix, clung
to it when condemned to the death he was always seeking
for others. The knife was blunt, and five times it was
raised before the head fell. “Quick—quick!” the wretch
cried, when it was raised for the fifth time.</p>

<p>Some time after, when the Terror was rising to its height,
Cholier was looked upon as a martyr; his body was burnt,
and the ashes placed in an urn, were carried triumphantly
through the streets, and placed upon an altar of patriotism
raised to him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_362"></a>[362]</span></p>

<p>The altar in question was soon thrown down.</p>

<p>But only after the Terror ended.</p>

<p>With Cholier’s after-death triumph, the “moderates”
began to fall. Ten of the municipals of Lyons (the place
of Cholier’s exploits) were beheaded in one day, and a mine
was exploded which destroyed the finest parts of the city.</p>

<p>Lyons was almost annihilated. At a cost of half a million
of money (English), houses worth twelve millions were
destroyed. Why? France was mad. So hurriedly was
this destruction effected, that hundreds of the workmen
themselves were buried in the ruins.</p>

<p>Life, however, was cheap.</p>

<p>Rags only were to be seen—a decent dress was equivalent
to condemnation. The city was dead but for the thunder
of fallen houses, the roar of cannon and the rattle of
musketry mowing down suspected people, and the shrill cry
of the ragged as they marked another head fall beneath the
guillotine knife. It was now looked upon as a distinction,
and reserved only for important people.</p>

<p>An entire generation was destroyed in Lyons alone.
Great houses were unowned—for their owners were dead.
Castles, churches, factories, work-shops, were closed, for
their heads had all passed under the guillotine.</p>

<p>Starvation increased, for the land lay a-dying.</p>

<p>The guillotine was getting old and worn-out at Lyons.</p>

<p>One morning, sixty-four are marched out to death. They
are bound, and ranged in a line before an open trench.
Three pieces of cannon, loaded with bullets, sweep the
ranks. Not half are touched. “Forward!” is the word
given to the dragoons, who hack and shoot down the
victims. This lasts two whole hours.</p>

<p>Nine hundred and thirty executioners, in the shape of
an entire regiment, were to send their victims, marshalled
in a row, into eternity at the same moment. At the order
“Fire!” four bullets struck at the life of the victims, all of
whom are tied to a rope stretched from tree to tree.</p>

<p>Strange—when the smoke arose, only half were found
dead. The rest remained either wounded or untouched.
The unscathed stared in horror; the wounded screamed to
be despatched.</p>

<p>The soldiers could not fire again. Some of the prisoners
had freed themselves, and were escaping. The dragoons<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_363"></a>[363]</span>
were ordered forward to cut them down. The victims were
killed piece-meal. One man, a mayor of his town, reached
the river, but there his bleeding hand betrayed him, and
he was cast into the river.</p>

<p>The soldiers protested against the use to which they
were put. The massacres lasted until night-fall. Yet
when the grave-diggers came next morning, some hearts
still beat. The sextons put the martyrs out of their misery
at once by blows on the head with their pickaxes.</p>

<p>“We are purging the land,” wrote Collet d’Herbois to
the Convention.</p>

<p>Every day twenty-two were regularly shot. By this
time, the fear of life rendered death sweet. Girls, men,
children, prayed that they might be shot with their parents.
Sometimes they permitted this, and little boys and girls
were shot, holding their father’s hands.</p>

<p>Women who were seen to shed tears at executions, were
shot.</p>

<p>Mourning was prohibited under pain of death.</p>

<p>One lad of fourteen, says, “Quick—quick! You have
killed papa! I want to overtake him!”</p>

<p>One De Rochefort<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> was accompanied by a son to the
butchering-ground, whither he went with three relatives.
The men fell—the boy, aged fifteen, remained standing.</p>

<p>The executioner hesitated—the people murmured.</p>

<p>“God save the King!” cried De Rochefort.</p>

<p>A moment—a report—he fell, shattered to death.</p>

<p>A lovely girl, fourteen, is brought before the judge for
refusing to wear the national cockade.</p>

<p>“Why do you refuse to wear it?” asks the judge.</p>

<p>“Because you <em>do</em>!” replies the child.</p>

<p>Her beauty, rather than justice, pleading for her, a sign
was made that a wreath should be put in her hair, the
emblem of liberation.</p>

<p>She cast it upon the ground. She died.</p>

<p>A man came to the Hall of Justice.</p>

<p>“You have slain my father, my brothers, my wife—kill
me. My religion forbids me to destroy myself. In mercy,
kill me.”</p>

<p>In mercy—they killed him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_364"></a>[364]</span></p>

<p>A woman, who had fought bravely in the earlier and
fairer time of the Revolution, was carried to the scaffold,
though about to become a mother. She did not fear death—she
pleaded for the other life.</p>

<p>She was laughed at—hooted—and so died.</p>

<p>A girl of seventeen, and much resembling Charlotte
Corday, was accused of having served as an artillerist in
the trenches of the forces opposed to the national forces.</p>

<p>“What is your name?”</p>

<p>“Mary; the name of the mother of the God for whom I
am about to die.”</p>

<p>“Your age?”</p>

<p>“Seventeen; the age of Charlotte Corday.”</p>

<p>“How!—at seventeen, fight against your country?”</p>

<p>“I fought to save it.”</p>

<p>“Citizen—we, your judges, admire your courage. What
would you do with your life if we gave it you?”</p>

<p>“Use it to kill you!”</p>

<p>She ascended the scaffold, alarmed at the crowd of people—fearless
of death. She refused the executioner’s help—cried
twice, “God save the King!”—and lay down to die.</p>

<p>After her death, the executioner found amongst her clothes
a note written in blood. It was from her lover, who had
been shot some days before.</p>

<p>The lovers were only separated by a few days. Their
history touched the people, but the people of that day did
not know how to pardon.</p>

<p>These awful executions were at last arrested, not because
the victims were exhausted, but because the soldiers threw
down their arms and positively refused any longer to play
the shameful parts of executioners.</p>

<p>Napoleon Bonaparte, the tyrant-liberator of the oppressed
republic, now rose to his first distinction.</p>

<p>The English were in possession of Toulon. Admiral
Hood was preparing to flood France with English red-coats.</p>

<p>Within a week Bonaparte had compelled the English to
retire, but not before they had destroyed the arsenal and
the whole of the French navy.</p>

<p>On the beach, fifteen thousand refugees from various
parts of France sought to get away to the combined English
and Spanish fleets.</p>

<p>A storm arose in the midst of this destruction. Seven<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_365"></a>[365]</span>
thousand were rescued from the vengeance of the Republican
arms; eight thousand perished.</p>

<p>These refugees were chiefly carried to Leghorn, where
their descendants still reside.</p>

<p>The Convention ordered that Toulon should be razed to the
ground for having submitted to the English.</p>

<p>This frantic order, however, was not carried out.</p>

<p>Napoleon was now Emperor of Toulon. Already he
disobeyed orders, and rose daily to power.</p>

<p>Marat had risen over the Girondists and Liberals, Danton
over him; Robespierre was to destroy Danton, but
Napoleon was to set his foot upon them all, and command,
until, in his turn, in 1815, he was to succumb.</p>

<span class="fs70">THE BLOOD OF WOMEN.</span></h2>


<p>Madame Roland who had now been imprisoned through
five long months, was the next celebrated victim demanded
by the people. She had conquered her weariness by writing
her life.</p>

<p>At one time, she sought to avoid death by poison; but
the memory of her child prevailed, and she lived on to the
end.</p>

<p>When the Girondists fell, she knew all hope of life for
herself was at an end. She was then removed to the prison
whence Marie Antoinette went to the scaffold—nay, she
was imprisoned in the adjoining cell; and here she passed
her days, watching the fragment of sky she could see
through the bars of her prison, or admiring the little
bunches of flowers the gaoler’s good-hearted wife sent to
her dungeon almost daily.</p>

<p>She was tried for being the wife of Roland, and the
friend of the Girondists. She was proud of the accusation,
declared herself to be so, and she heard her condemnation
to death with a calm bearing and a smiling face.</p>

<p>“I thank you,” she said, “that you think me worthy to
share the fate of great and good men.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_366"></a>[366]</span></p>

<p>That same day she was placed in the last of a number of
carts, her only companion being an old man. Her beauty
was more than radiant, seated so near trembling age.</p>

<p>She wore a white dress, and her long black hair streamed
down her back.</p>

<p>Near the scaffold had been erected a colossal statue of
Liberty. When she ascended the scaffold, she bowed to the
statue, and cried, “Oh Liberty, how much crime is committed
in your name!”</p>

<p>But she had shown her woman’s tenderness at the foot of
the scaffold. She said to her companion, “Go first, that
you may not see me die. Let me save you that pain.”</p>

<p>She died quite fearlessly.</p>

<p>The next day, some peasants, driving home their flocks,
found the dead body of a man, a sword-stick blade through
his heart. The position of the remains proved suicide,
effected by putting the sword-handle against a tree, when the
sufferer flung himself upon the point. A paper found upon
the dead man contained these words:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Whoever thou art that findest these remains, respect
them as those of a virtuous man. After my wife’s death, I
will not remain another day upon this earth, so stained
with crimes.”</p>
</div>

<p>This was Madame Roland’s husband.</p>

<p>Very different from this honest woman’s death was that
of Madame Dubarry, mistress of Louis XV. Her crime
was the concealment of a treasure. As a King’s favorite,
she had amassed enormous wealth. Strangely enough, it
was a favorite of her own—a negro boy she had adopted—that
denounced her. She was condemned, and she went
shrieking to the scaffold—the only instance of this kind
amongst all the women who died during the Reign of Terror.</p>

<p>Her beauty was her crime.</p>

<p>“Life!” she cried. “Life for repentance—for devotion
to the Republic! All my treasures for a little life!”</p>

<p>The knife only cut short these ignoble cries.</p>

<p>The next thing done was the abolition of the name of the
days of the weeks and months of the year, because they
were idolatrous.</p>

<p>Finally, the Catholic faith was abolished, the church bells
were cast into money, the worship of the Goddess of Reason,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_367"></a>[367]</span>
was proclaimed. The proclamation was carried into
effect at the Cathedral. An actress, one Mdlle. Maillard,
beautiful, talented, and a favorite of the late Queen’s, was
compelled to play the part of the goddess.</p>

<p>She was borne into the church (the only one now open in
all Paris) upon a kind of litter, covered with oak branches,
and followed by girls dressed in white, singing jubilant
songs. About the altar were the opera choristers and others.
The actress was now placed upon the altar, and she was
worshipped by those present. The Bishop had been compelled
to appear, and he sat motionless with fear, tears of
shame coursing down his face.</p>

<p>The burial places of the Kings were now invaded. The
remains of a thousand years of kings were torn from the
vaults of St. Denis, and cast into the country ditches. Nothing
was spared—anything which suggested royalty, was
destroyed.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Carrier, at Nantes, surpassed in outrage all
that had gone before him. It was charitable to suppose
he was sheer mad.</p>

<p>Men, women, children, and especially priests, were shot
down by Carrier’s orders. He said trial was useless. His
rivals had abandoned the guillotine for the butchery of the
soldier’s lead. Carrier improved upon this. He said he
hated blood, so he positively sank hundreds, thousands of
accused, in huge barges. They were carried down to the
bottom, and there to this day they remain.</p>

<p>Carrier was the deputy sent by the Convention, of which
Robespierre was now King.</p>

<p>These massacres lasted months. Some complaints were
sent to Paris. Carrier seized two hundred of the principal
merchants of the place, cast them into prison, tortured them,
and then drowned the men.</p>

<p>At last, his madness becoming apparent, he was recalled.
Robespierre did not demand his punishment; and this
omission of justice was one of the accusations brought
against Robespierre at <em>his</em> trial.</p>

<p>A woman began the attack upon Robespierre. She was
Rose Lacombe, beautiful, eloquent, revolutionary; but
pitying and hating blood. She was seized with love for a
young prisoner, tried to save him, failed, and she devoted
herself to Robespierre’s death.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_368"></a>[368]</span></p>

<p>Robespierre, to retain his popularity, determined to
sacrifice Danton, Camille Desmoulins, and others. They
fell—all of them.</p>

<p>As these victims, on their way to execution, passed
Duplay’s house, the shutters of which were closed, the
crowd burst into a roar of applause. Robespierre watching,
trembled.</p>

<p>A very short span, and his time was to come.</p>

<p>Herault de Sechelles was the first to alight from the cart.
He turned to embrace Danton, when the executioner
pulled him away.</p>

<p>“Brute!” said Danton; “but you cannot prevent our
lips touching in the basket.”</p>

<p>Camille Desmoulins was the last but one of the four.
He was quite resigned. He looked at the knife, then
turning to the people, he said, “Look on at the end of the
first apostle of liberty! He who murders me will not
survive me long!”</p>

<p>“Send this lock of hair to my mother,” he said to the
executioner.</p>

<p>They were his last words.</p>

<p>Danton ascended last. He never looked more haughty
and defiant. For one moment he broke down. “Wife!”
he screamed.</p>

<p>Then he added, “Come, come, Danton; no weakness.
Executioner, show my head to the people; it is worth
looking at!”</p>

<p>The executioner caught the head as it was falling, and
carried it round the scaffold.</p>

<p>The mob applauded. Such is the end of favorites.</p>

<p>Eight thousand people were awaiting death in the prisons
of Paris alone, within a month of Danton’s death.</p>

<p>Robespierre was delicate and decent in his power and
supreme cruelty, but he capped all his compeers. Men and
women were not shot or drowned in Paris, but the guillotine
worked unceasingly.</p>

<p>Certain children had, in 1791, taken part in receiving
the Prussian General at Verdun. They were all brought
to Paris, and guillotined.</p>

<p>The nuns of Montmartre were carried, abbess, young
girls, and old women, all to the scaffold—for praying! As<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_369"></a>[369]</span>
the Girondists sang their hymns, so these poor women sang
theirs. The last death ended the last note of this hymn.</p>

<p>It was thus Robespierre—now alone of all those with
whom he first came into power—and his satellites maintained
their power.</p>

<p>One, and only one, grown-up scion of royalty remained—Madame
Elizabeth.</p>

<p>It was then more than a year since the King died. She
and the Princess remained together—deprived even of
cards, because of the kings and queens in the pack.</p>

<p>As for the Dauphin, he was confined in a room the bed
of which he never left. His bread was thrown to him.
No one ever spoke to him, and his clothes had not been
changed for nearly twelve months. His window would not
open. He was allowed no books, paper, or playthings; in
a word, he was brutalized at six years of age. His limbs
stiffened, and he became an idiot, in which state he died.</p>

<p>The aunt and sister could hear nothing about the child.
They were treated tolerably well, but during Lent they
were only given fat meat to eat. This their consciences
would not allow them to touch, and for forty days they only
ate bread.</p>

<p>The summons came suddenly at night-time. The little
Princess, the only one of the five prisoners of the Temple
who survived the Reign of Terror, wept, clung to her aunt—but
lost her.</p>

<p>Her defence was very simple:—“I am tried because I
am the King’s sister. You call him a tyrant. Had he
been, you would not have been where you are; I not be
where I am!”</p>

<p>The people demanded her life, and they obtained it.</p>

<p>The very women who generally yelled around the carts
were dumb, as this serene, angelic woman was carried
through the streets. She died so peacefully, that many
envied her.</p>

<span class="fs70 lsp2">ROBESPIERRE FALLS.</span></h2>


<p>Atheism was now preached openly.</p>

<p>Robespierre pronounced in favor of an unknown deity,
and in so magnificent a speech, that it may be said he gave
back religion to France.</p>

<p>But his time had come.</p>

<p>What was his crime in the eyes of his accusers? Unpopularity.</p>

<p>One night he is addressing the Convention, when the
uproar is so incessant, that in endeavoring to make himself
heard, his voice fails him.</p>

<p>The people were already looking towards Napoleon—the
man of the sword, not of the tongue.</p>

<p>Robespierre fell back upon silence, but he was always to
be seen at his place at the Convention. Hour after hour,
friends became enemies.</p>

<p>He knew he was condemned, but he waited.</p>

<p>Here is the final scene:—</p>

<p>Robespierre and his friends, St. Just, Couthon, and
Lebas, seated in a room by themselves, hear the jingle of
approaching soldiers. Lebas takes one of a couple of
pistols, and presents it—“Robespierre, let us die.”</p>

<p>“No; I await the executioner,” says Robespierre, and
the other two murmur in assent.</p>

<p>The sounds come nearer.</p>

<p>A report—and Lebas falls. He has shot himself through
the heart.</p>

<p>The soldier-insurgents swarm into the room.</p>

<p>“Down with the tyrant! Where is he?”</p>

<p>These were the cries Robespierre heard.</p>

<p>He did not quail.</p>

<p>“Which is the man?” asks a soldier of Léonard Bourdon,
who did not face his fallen enemy.</p>

<p>He pointed the questioner’s pistol at Robespierre, and he
said, “That is the man.”</p>

<p>The report was heard, and the next moment Robespierre’s
head fell upon the proclamation he was signing at
the instant.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_371"></a>[371]</span></p>

<p>The ball had entered the left side of the face, and carried
away part of the cheek and several teeth.</p>

<p>Couthon tried to rise, and fell to the ground.</p>

<p>St. Just sat calmly glancing from his fallen friend to his
enemies.</p>

<p>The procession to the Convention was horrible enough.
It was now daybreak.</p>

<p>First was carried Robespierre, on a litter, his face tied up
in a handkerchief; then came his brother, insensible, in the
arms of two men; then followed the dead body of Lebas,
over which they had thrown a table-cover.</p>

<p>Couthon, who had rolled in the mud, followed; and the
procession was closed by St. Just, walking bare-headed.</p>

<p>“The recreant Robespierre is here!” said the President
of the Convention, a man just chosen. “Shall he be
brought in?”</p>

<p>“No, no!” cried the Conventionists. “The corpse of a
tyrant can carry nothing but contagion along with it. To
the scaffold!”</p>

<p>Robespierre was put aside in a room, and hundreds of
people pushed in to assure themselves the tyrant was dead.</p>

<p>He heard and saw all; but could not speak.</p>

<p>At three, he and his friends were tried. At six, they
were being conveyed in carts to execution.</p>

<p>There was no lack of people to see Robespierre die;
women dressed as for a ball, believing that with Robespierre
the Reign of Terror was at an end.</p>

<p>Children huddled around the carts—orphans of his
victims—crying, “Kill him! kill him!”</p>

<p>His procession to the scaffold was a line of loud-spoken
imprecations.</p>

<p>He never spoke or uttered a cry, except when the
bandage was taken from his face; then a scream, heard
many hundred yards away, burst from him.</p>

<p>His head fell—he and the Terror ended together.</p>

<p>France fell into the hands of Napoleon.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>My tale is done. I have said very little about myself—I,
Réné Besson, found in my old age by Alexander Dumas,
seated in the sunlight. I married Estelle Duplay (the
furies broke into the house of Duplay, the day after<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_372"></a>[372]</span>
Robespierre’s death, and killed his poor wife), and found
peace and happiness. One last word! I have never regretted
saving Sophie Gerbaut, and the Viscount de Malmy,
from the Terror. That I did. I am now an old man. My
very last words are these. The Revolution was terrible,
but it did the world more good in the long run than the
world has yet found out.</p>

<p class="noindent fs70"><em>Read what the Editors of the New York Weekly say of it, in their paper, editorially</em>:</p>

<p class="fs70">“Mrs. Ann S. Stephens has thrown into ‘The Curse of Gold’ all that
graphic delineation of passion and character, beauty and strength of style,
reality of description, sweep of imagination, brilliancy of fashion, power
over the fount of tears and laughter, and trenchant sarcasm which have
male her writings the source of great pleasure to readers of fiction
wherever the English language is known.</p>

<p class="fs70">“‘The Curse of Gold’ will be found to be one of the most thrilling,
intensely absorbing, unfailingly interesting, and delightfully romantic
stories which Mrs. Stephens has ever penned.</p>

<p class="fs70">“‘The Curse of Gold’ never drags, but from the first chapter to the last
the intense interest is maintained, and incident follows incident, action
follows action with such rapidity that the reader is hurried along, fascinated
in the various windings and unwindings of the plot. The characters
are so naturally portrayed that they appear to have been drawn from real
life. The situations are never overstrained, nor yet commonplace, but of
a nature to excite the attention and elicit the admiration of the reader at
the fertility of invention of the author.”</p>
